  !: fixed/modified feature, -: deleted feature, +: new feature

1.7.7 -- XX-09-2021
  + BGP, BMP, Streaming Telemetry daemons: introduced parallelization
    of dump events via a configurable amount of workers where the unit
    of parallelization is the exporter (BGP, BMP, telemetry exporter),
    ie. in a scenario where there are 4 workers and 4 exporters each
    worker is assigned one exporter data to dump.
  + pmtelemetryd: added support for draft-ietf-netconf-udp-notif:
    a UDP-based notification mechanism to collect data from networking
    devices. A shim header is proposed to facilitate the data streaming
    directly from the publishing process on network processor of line
    cards to receivers. The objective is a lightweight approach to
    enable higher frequency and less performance impact on publisher
    and receiver process compared to already established notification
    mechanisms. Many thanks to Alex Huang Feng ( @ahuangfeng ) and the
    whole Unyte team.
  + BGP, BMP, Streaming Telemetry daemons: now correctly honouring the
    supplied Kafka partition key for BGP, BMP and Telemetry msg logs
    and dump events.
  + BGP, BMP daemons: a new "rd_origin" field is added to output log/
    dump to specify the source of Route Distinguisher information (ie.
    flow vs BGP vs BMP).
  + pre_tag_map: added ability to tag new NetFlow/IPFIX and sFlow
    sample_type types: "flow-ipv4", "flow-ipv6", "flow-mpls-ipv4" and
    "flow-mpls-ipv6". Also added a new "is_bi_flow" true/false key to
    tag (or exclude) NSEL bidirectional flows. Added as well a new
    "is_multicast" true/false config key to tag (or exclude) IPv4/IPv6
    multicast destinations.
  + maps_index: enables indexing of maps to increase lookup speeds on
    large maps and/or sustained lookup rates. The feature has been
    remplemented using stream-lined structures from libcdada. This is
    a major work that helps preventing the unpredictable behaviours
    caused by the homegrown map indexing mechanism. Many thanks to
    Marc Sune ( @msune ).
  + maps_index: support for indexing src_net and dst_net keywords has
    been added.
  + Added <daemon_name>_ipv6_only config directives to optionally
    enable the IPV6_V6ONLY socket option. Also changed the wrong
    setsockopt() IPV6_BINDV6ONLY id to IPV6_V6ONLY.
  + Added log function to libserdes to debug transactions with the
    Schema Registry when kafka_avro_schema_registry is set.
  + nDPI: newer versions of the library (ie. >= 3.5) bring changes
    to the API. pmacct is now aligned to compile against these.
  + pmacctd: added pcap_arista_trailer_offset config directive since
    Arista has changed the structure of the trailer format in recent
    releases of EOS. Thanks to Jeremiah Millay ( @floatingstatic )
    for his patch.
  + More improvements carried out on the Continuous Integration
    (CI) side by migrating from Travis CI to GitHub Actions. Huge
    thanks to Marc Sune ( @msune ) to make all of this possible.
  + More improvements also carried out in the space of the Docker
    images being created: optimized image size and a better layered
    pipeline. Thanks to Marc Sune ( @msune ) and Daniel Caballero
    ( @dcaba ) to make all of this possible.
  + libcdada shipped with pmacct was upgraded to version 0.3.5. Many
    thanks Marc Sune ( @msune ) for his work with libcdada.
  ! build system: several improvements carried out in this area,
    ie. improved MySQL checks, introduced pcap-config tool for
    libpcap, compiling on BSD/old compilers, etc. Monumental thanks
    to Marc Sune ( @msune ) for his continued help.
  ! fix, nfacctd: improved euristics to support the case of flows
    with both IPv4 and IPv6 source / destination addresses (either
    or populated). Also improved euristics to distinguish event data
    vs traffic data in NetFlow v9/IPFIX from Cisco 9300/9500, ASA
    firewalls and Cisco 4500X.
  ! fix, nfacctd: improved support for initiatorOctets (IE #231) and
    responderOctets (IE #232). Thanks to Esben Laursen ( @hyberdk )
    for reporting the issue.
  ! fix, nfacctd: in NF_mpls_vpn_id_handler() double ntohl() calls
    were applied for the case of 'vrfid'-encoded mpls_vpn_rd field.
  ! fix, sfacctd: wrong ethertype set for VLAN-tagged, MPLS-labelled
    IPv6 traffic. Impacting BGP resolution among others. Thanks to
    Jeremiah Millay ( @floatingstatic ) for his help resolving the
    problem.
  ! fix, BGP, BMP daemons: parsing improvements: added a check for
    BGP Open message and BGP Open Options lengths. Strengthened
    parsing of Peer Up, Route Monitoring and Peer Down v4 messages.
  ! fix, BGP, BMP daemon: when using Avro encoding and Avro Schema
    Registry, attempt to reconnect if serdes schemas are voided.
    Also now checking for serdes schema definitions before doing a
    serdes_schema_serialize_avro() to avoid triggering a SEGV.
    Finally improved serdes logging.
  ! fix, BGP, Streaming Telemetry daemons: in daemon logs, summary
    counters for amount of tables / entries dumped were wrong.
  ! fix, BGP daemon: distinguish among null and zero value AIGP
    and Prefix SID attributes. Same applies for Local Preference
    and MED attributes.
  ! fix, BMP daemon: resolved a memory leak in bgp_peers_free().
    Thanks to Pether Pothier ( @pothier-peter ) for his patch. Also
    resolved a leak caused by an invalid BGP message contained in a
    BMP Route Message v4.
  ! fix, BMP daemon: correctly setting peer_ip and peer_tcp_port
    JSON fields for Term messages. Also the correct bmp_router
    value when bmp_daemon_parse_proxy_header feature is enabled.
  ! fix, BMP daemon: several encoding issues when using Apache Avro
    ie. u_int64_t now correctly encoded with avro_value_set_long(),
    certain u_int32_t fields switched to avro_value_set_long() due
    to lack of unsignedness in Avro encoding, improved various
    aspectes of Avro-JSON format output, etc.
  ! fix, pmtelemetryd: wrong parsing of pm_tfind() output was
    leading to mistaken data attribution of UDP-based peers (always
    first peer to connect was being picked).
  ! fix, pmtelemetryd: when set, the pidfile config directive was
    not being correctly honoured.
  ! fix, RPKI: the RTR PDU element for maxLength is uint8, therefore
    it might have been possible to transmit incorrect RTR data.
    Thanks to Job Snijders ( @job ) for his patch. 
  ! fix, SQL plugins: amended the text composition of SQL queries
    that are involving latitude and longitude keys.
  ! fix, MySQL plugin: check for 'unix:' prefix string only when a
    sql_host configuration directive is specified.
  ! fix, nfprobe: modernized Application Information export. Until
    the previous release pmacct was adhering to aging NBAR model
    whereas now NBAR2 has been implemented. Thanks to Rob Cowart
    ( @robcowart ) for helping out resolving this issue.
  ! fix, tee plugin: restored usefulness of tee_source_ip which was
    broken in 1.7.6. Thanks to Jeremiah Millay ( @floatingstatic )
    for reporting the issue.
  ! fix, maps_index: indexing of mpls_pw_id was broken. Also now,
    when the feature is enabled, actual data is being referenced in
    the index structure instead of creating a copy of it; thanks to
    Sander van Delden ( @SanderDelden ) for reporting the memory
    leak that was resulting from the copy.
  ! fix, kafka_common.c: solved memory leak in p_kafka_set_topic()
    when Kafka session was getting in down state. Many thanks to
    Peter Pothier ( @pothier-peter ) for nailing the issue.
  ! fix, net_aggr.[ch]: when a networks_file is specified in the
    config, gracefully handle max memory structure depth; added
    also de-duplication of entries.
  ! fix, pmacct-defines.h: if PCAP_NETMASK_UNKNOWN is not defined,
    ie. in libpcap < 1.1.0, let's define it.
  ! fix, SO_REUSEPORT feature was being restricted to Linux only in
    previous releases: now it has been unlocked to all other OS that
    do support the feature.
  ! fix, split SO_REUSEPORT and SO_REUSEADDR setsockopt() calls.
    Thanks to @eduarrrd for reporting and resolving the issue.
  ! fix, several code warnings catched gcc9 and clang.
  - Obsoleted sql_history_since_epoch, pre_tag_map_entries and
    refresh_maps configuration directives.

1.7.6 -- 07-02-2021
  + Added dependency to libcdada in an effort to streamline basic
    data structures needed for everyday coding. All new structures
    will make use of libcdada, old ones will be ported over time.
    Libcdada offers basic data structures in C: ie. list, set, map/
    hash table, queue and is a libstdc++ wrapper. Many thanks to
    Marc Sune ( @msune ) for his work with libcdada and his enormous
    help facilitating the integration.
  + BGP daemon: added suppport for Accumulated IGP Metric Attribute
    (AIGP) and Label-Index TLV of Prefix-SID Attribute.
  + BGP daemon: added SO_KEEPALIVE TCP socket option (ie. to keep the
    sessions alive via a firewall / NAT kind of device). Thanks to
    Jared Mauch ( @jaredmauch ) for his patch.
  + BGP daemon: if comparing source TCP ports among BGP peers is
    being enabled (config directive tmp_bgp_lookup_compare_ports),
    print also BGP Router-ID as distinguisher as part of log/dump
    output.
  + BMP daemon: added support for HAProxy Proxy Protocol Header in
    the first BMP message in order to determine the original sender
    IP address and port. The new bmp_daemon_parse_proxy_header config
    directive enables the feature. Contribution is by Peter Pothier
    ( @pothier-peter ).
  + BMP daemon: improved support and brought implementation on par
    with the latest drafting efforts at IETF wrt draft-cppy-grow-bmp-
    path-marking-tlv, draft-xu-grow-bmp-route-policy-attr-trace,
    draft-ietf-grow-bmp-tlv and draft-lucente-grow-bmp-tlv-ebit.
  + BMP daemon: added 'bgp_agent_map' equivalent feature for BMP.
  + nfacctd, nfprobe plugin: added support for collection and export
    of NetFlow/IPFIX data over Datagram Transport Layer Security (in
    short DTLS). The feature depends on the GnuTLS library.
  + nfacctd: added support for deprecated NetFlow v9 IE #104
    (layer2packetSectionData) as it is implemented for NetFlow-lite
    on Cisco devices. Reused code from IPFIX IE #315.
  + nfacctd: added support for MPLS VPN RD IE #90. This comes in two
    flavours both found across vendor implementations: 1) IE present
    in flow data and 2) IE present in Options data as a lookup from
    IE #234 (ingressVRFID) and #235 (egressVRFID).
  + nfacctd: added a new timestamp_export aggregation primitive to
    record the timestamp being carried in the header of NetFlow/IPFIX
    messates (that is, the time at which the export was performed).
  + nfprobe plugin: added support for ICMP/ICMPv6 information as part
    of the NetFlow/IPFIX export. The piece of info is encoded in the
    destination port field as per the current common understandings
    across vendors. As a result of that, the 'dst_port' primitive is
    to be part of the aggregation method in order to leverage this
    feature.
  + MySQL plugin: introduced support to connect to a MySQL server
    via UNIX sockets.
  + tee plugin: added crc32 hash algorithm as a new balancing option
    for nodes in the receiving pool. It hashes original exporter IP
    address against a crc32 function. Thanks to @edge-intelligence
    for the contribution.
  + Massive improvements carried out on the Continuous Integration
    (CI) side, ie. to ensure better quality of the code, and on the
    containerization side by offering official stable / bleeding edge
    Docker images. Huge thanks to Marc Sune ( @msune ) to make all of
    this possible.
  ! fix, BGP daemon: re-worked internal structuring of 'modern' BGP
    attributes: for the sake of large-scale space optimization
    certain attributes are confined in a separate (less used)
    bgp_info_extra structure.
  ! fix, BGP daemon: improved support for BGP ADD-PATH, ie. made it
    per Address-Family rather than global. Also comparisons upon
    doing route looup were improved and normalized. 
  ! fix, BGP daemon: use split buffers for recv and send functions
    of the BGP x-connects feature. Also improved validation when
    processing a bgp_daemon_xconnect_map.
  ! fix, BGP daemon: when using BGP x-connects, close unused file
    descriptors in bgp_peer_xconnect_init() in order to avoid
    quickly reaching the maximum amount of allowed open descriptors
    in case of BGP flaps.
  ! fix, BGP daemon: trigger a log message for a missing entry while
    processing bgp_daemon_xconnect_map in bgp_peer_xconnect_init().
  ! fix, BGP daemon: enabled log notifications (that is, log anti-
    spam measure) upon reaching limit of allowed BGP peers.
  ! fix, BGP daemon: ecommunity_ecom2str(), first thing make sure
    that the destination size is enough! Missing this did cause some
    SEGVs due to heap corruption. Thanks to Chris Danis ( @cdanis )
    for his help resolving the issue.
  ! fix, BGP daemon: solved a memory leak in aspath_make_str_count()
    by returning result from aspath_make_empty(), if any. Thanks very
    much to Peter Pothier ( @pothier-peter ) for his contribution.
  ! fix, BMP daemon: several encoding issues when using Apache Avro
    ie. missing conditional branching, wrong field names, etc. Thanks
    also to Raphael Barazzutti ( @rbarazzutti ) for several of those
    fixes.
  ! fix, BMP daemon: throw an error for any issues (error or zero
    length) related to the BGP Update PDU parsing; also added marker
    and length checks for BGP Open PDU in Peer Up messages.
  ! fix, BMP daemon: both timestamp of the BMP event and its
    arrival at the collector are now recorded and printed out
    separately; before they were wrongly muxed on one single field
    making it uncertain for the user what was the time reference.
  ! fix, BMP daemon: correctly print Peer Distinguisher for Route
    Monitoring messages. Also improved BMP lookup comparisons in
    order to factor in Peer Distinguisher if any.
  ! fix, BMP daemon: print 'is_in' boolean for Adj-Rib-In data
    instead of having it implicit. Also print 'is_post' for Post-
    Policy Adj-Rib-In data.
  ! fix, BMP daemon: upon receipt of a Termination message, do
    proactively close the TCP session.
  ! fix, nDPI: newer versions of the library (ie. >= 3.2) require
    calling ndpi_finalize_initialization() somewhere after the
    detection module init finished. Contribution is from Toni Uhlig
    ( @lnslbrty ).
  ! fix, pmacctd: link checks were being mistakenly skipped when
    reading from a pcap_savefile. Also now if a selected aggregation
    primitive is unsuitable for a given Layer2, it is simply cleared
    (with an info message issued) instead of making the daemon bail
    out.
  | fix, print plugin: bail the plugin out if its output was set to
    stdout while the daemon was started as daemonized.
  ! fix, PostgreSQL plugin: in PG_compose_conn_string() allow any
    intersection of host, port and cafile options.
  ! fix, nfprobe plugin: changed default export version from NetFlow
    v5 to IPFIX.
  ! fix, sfprobe plugin: FreeBSD was complaining of errno 22 (Invalid
    argument) upon sendto().
  ! fix, tee plugin: replication of IPv6 packets has been now tested
    working. Previously the output message size was obviously encoded
    wrongly and the checksum (mandatory piece of info to fill in IPv6,
    contrary to IPv4 where it is optional) was not being computed.
  ! fix, kafka_common.c: improved p_kafka_check_outq_len() error log
    message to report the amount of elements have been successfully
    processed in order to better assess impact and dynamics of the
    problem when inspecting logs.
  ! fix, net_aggr.c: if networks_file_filter is set to true, don't
    add a default route to the table.
  ! fix, cfg.c: throw error if config file is not a regular file.
  ! fix, compiling against gcc10: renamed some variables and unified
    declaration of others in order to be more friendly to the new
    version of gcc. Also fixed several code warnings catched gcc8.
  - Removed the IP prefix label feature that was enabled via the
    --enable-plabel configure script switch.

1.7.5 -- 17-06-2020
  + pmacct & Redis: pmacct daemons can now connect to a Redis cache.
    The main use-case currenly covered is: registering every stable
    daemon component in a table so to have, when running a cluster
    comprising several daemons / components, an olistic view of what
    is currently running and where; shall a component stop running
    or crash it will disappear from the inventory.
  + BMP daemon: as part of the IETF 107 vHackaton, preliminar support
    for draft-xu-grow-bmp-route-policy-attr-trace and draft-lucente-
    grow-bmp-tlv-ebit was introduced. Also added support for Peer
    Distinguisher field in the BMP Per-Peer Header.
  + BMP daemon: added support for reading from savefiles in libpcap
    format (pcap_savefile, pcap_savefile_delay, pcap_savefile_replay,
    pcap_filter) as an alternative to the use of bmp_play.py.
  + BMP daemon: re-worked, improved and generalized support for TLVs
    at the end of BMP messages. In this context, unknown Stats data
    is handled as a generic TLV. 
  + BMP daemon: added SO_KEEPALIVE TCP socket option (ie. to keep the
    sessions alive via a firewall / NAT kind of device). Thanks to
    Jared Mauch ( @jaredmauch ) for his patch. 
  + nfacctd, nfprobe plugin: added usec timestamp resolution to IPFIX
    collector and export via IEs #154, #155. For export, this can be
    configured via the new nfprobe_tstamp_usec knob.
  + nfacctd: new nfacctd_templates_receiver and nfacctd_templates_port
    config directives allow respectively to specify a destination
    where to copy NetFlow v9/IPFIX templates to and a port where to
    listen for templates from. If nfacctd_templates_receiver points to
    a replicator and the replicator exports to nfacctd_templates_port
    of a set of collectors then, for example, it gets possible to share
    templates among collectors in a cluster for the purpose of seamless
    scale-out.
  + pmtelemetryd: in addition to existing TCP, UDP and ZeroMQ inputs,
    the daemon can now read Streaming Telemetry data in JSON format
    from a Kafka broker (telemetry_daemon_kafka_* config knobs).
  + pmgrpcd.py: Use of multiple processes for the Kafka Avro exporter
    to leverage the potential of multi-core/processors architectures.
    Code is from Raphael P. Barazzutti ( @rbarazzutti ).
  + pmgrpcd.py: added -F / --no-flatten command-line option to disable
    object flattening (default true for backward compatibility); also
    export to a Kafka broker for (flattened) JSON objects was added (in
    addition to existing export to ZeroMQ).
  + nDPI: introduced support for nDPI 3.2 and dropped support for all
    earlier versions of the library due to changes to the API.
  + Docker: embraced the technology for CI purposes; added a docker/
    directory in the file distribution where Dockerfile and scripts to
    build pmacct and dependencies are shared. Thanks to Claudio Ortega
    ( @claudio-ortega ) for contributing his excellent work in the area.
  ! fix, pmacctd: pcap_setdirection() enabled and moved to the right
    place in code. Libpcap tested for function presence. Thanks to
    Mikhail Sennikovsky for his patch.
  ! fix, pmacctd: SEGV has been detected if passing messages with an
    unsupported link layer. 
  ! fix, uacctd: handle non-ethernet packets correctly. Use mac_len = 0
    for non-ethernet packets in which case a zeroed ethernet header is
    used. Thanks to @aleksandrgilfanov for his patch.
  ! fix, BGP daemon: improved handling of withdrawals for label-unicast
    and mpls-vpn NLRIs.
  ! fix, BGP daemon: improved decoding of MPLS labels by passing it via
    a "0x%02x%02x%01x" formatter. In the past some labels may have been
    printed out incorrectly.
  ! fix, BGP daemon: decoding origin field correctly. Thanks to Peter
    Pothier ( @pothier-peter ) for his patch.
  ! BGP Looking Glass: LG code was moved from pmbgpd to pmacct libbgp
    so to be re-used in other components (ie. BGP thread of a flow
    daemon, BMP daemon, etc.).
  ! fix, BMP daemon: timestamps for Route Monitoring message were set
    to the current time rather than timestamp in the Per-Peer Header.
    Thanks to Peter Pothier ( @pothier-peter ) for reporting the issue.
  ! fix, BMP daemon: V flag test to allow IPv6 prefixes/peers was not
    correct (details in PR #362 on GitHub). Thanks @bcavns01 for his
    patch.
  ! fix, BGP, BMP daemons: modified approach to message segmentation
    by ensuring reading exactly one message at a time (instead of the
    previous unaligned approach that was aiming to fill the available
    read buffer up) and waiting for all segments be available before
    processing a message (instead of the previous greedy approach that
    was trying to parse also partial messages). 
  ! fix, RPKI daemon: in rpki_prefix_lookup_node_match_cmp() prevent
    invalid results to over-write a previously computed valid one.
  ! fix, pmtelemetryd: recv() does include a MSG_WAITALL option to make
    sure all data is available before processing a given message; now
    n alarm() syscall is introduced so to prevent stalls due to bogus /
    incomplete data.
  ! fix, tee plugin: Tee_init_socks() now does not overwrite previously
    computed address length anymore: issues were repoted with IPv6 IPv4-
    mapped addresses. 
  ! fix, nfprobe plugin: take into account ingress/egress interfaces,
    if available, when comparing flows. Thanks to Mikhail Sennikovsky
    for his patch.
  ! fix, pretag.c: incorrect string termiantion in pretag_copy_label()
    was making the daemon SEGV upon certain conditions when defining
    set_label statements in a pre_tag_map.
  ! fix, pretag_handlers.c: pretag_copy_label() instead of memcpy() in
    pretag_label_handler() to not borrow reference to label value and
    consequently lead to SEGV.
  ! fix, zmq_common.c: missing variable init in p_zmq_zap_handler() was
    giving troubles with gcc7 compiler optimizations. Thanks to Yuri
    Lachin ( @yuyutime ) for his support resolving this bug.
  ! fix, sql_common.c: print custom primitives with hex semantics among
    quotes. Hexs require a char type defined in the SQL table schema.
  ! fix, addr.c: passing right aligned argument to ip6_addr_cmp() in
    host_addr_mask_cmp(). This was found to impact selective replication
    of IPv6 flows basing on src_net and/or dst_net primitives in the
    pre_tag_map.
  ! fix, several code warnings catched by gcc7 and gcc8. Also several
    functions were renamed to avoid namespace conflicts with linked
    libraries.
  - Obsoleted --enable-64bit knob which was already defaulting to true
    for some releases already.
  - Obsoleted savefile_wait config knob (pcap_savefile_wait must be
    used instead).

1.7.4p1 -- 09-02-2020
  ! fix, pre_tag_map: a memory leak in pretag_entry_process() has been
    introduced in 1.7.4. Thanks to Fabien Vincent and Olivier Benghozi
    for their support resolving the issue.

1.7.4 -- 31-12-2019
  + Released pmgrpcd.py v3: a Streaming Telemetry collector and decoder
    for multi-vendor environments written in Python3. It supports gRPC
    transport along with Protobuf encoding as input and can output to
    Kafka with Avro encoding. Output to files and JSON encoding is
    currently supported sending data via ZMQ to pmtelemetryd first. It
    was tested working with data input from Cisco and Huawei routers
    and v3 replaces v2. Thanks to the Streaming Telemetry core team:
    Matthias Arnold ( @tbearma1 ), Camilo Cardona ( @jccardonar ),
    Thomas Graf ( @graf3 , @graf3net ), Paolo Lucente ( @paololucente ).
  + Introduced support for the 'vxlan' VXLAN/VNI primitive in all traffic
    daemons (NetFlow/IPFIX, sFlow and libpcap/ULOG). Existing inner tunnel
    primitives (ie. tunnel_src_host, tunnel_dst_host, tunnel_proto, etc.)
    have been wired to the VXLAN decoding and new ones (tunnel_src_mac, 
    tunnel_dst_mac, tunnel_src_port, tunnel_dst_port) were defined.
  + BMP daemon: added support for Peer Up message namespace for TLVs
    (draft-ietf-grow-bmp-peer-up) and also support for Route Monitor
    and Peer Down TLVs (draft-ietf-grow-bmp-tlv).
  + BGP, BMP daemons: in addition to existing JSON export, data can now
    be exported in Apache Avro format. There is also support for the
    Confluent Schema Registry.
  + Introduced support for JSON-encoded Apache Avro encoding. While the
    binary-encoded Apache Avro is always recommended for any production
    scenarios (also to optionallly leverage Confluent Schema Registry
    support), JSON-encoded is powerful for testing and troubleshooting
    scenarios.
  + sfprobe plugin: added support for IPv6 transport for sFlow export.
    sfprobe_agentip is an IP address put in the header of the sFlow
    packet. If underlying transport is IPv6, this must be configured to
    an IPv6 address.
  + zmq_common.[ch]: Improved modularity of the ZMQ internal API and
    decoupled bind/connect from push/pull and pub/sub; also improved
    support for inproc sockets. All to increase the amount of use-cases
    covered by the API.
  + bgp_peer_src_as_map: added 'filter' key to cover pmacctd/uacctd use
    cases.
  + nfprobe, sfprobe plugins: introduced [sn]fprobe_index_override to
    override ifindexes dynamically determined (ie. by NFLOG) with values
    computed by [sn]fprobe_ifindex.
  + MySQL, PostgreSQL plugins: added support for SSL/TLS connections by
    specifying a CA certificate (sql_conn_ca_file).
  + Kafka, AMQP plugins: amqp_markers and kafka_markers have now been
    properly re-implemented when output encoding is Avro using an own
    Avro schema (instead of squatting pieces of JSON in the data stream
    for the very purpose).
  + print plugin: introduced print_write_empty_file config knob (true,
    false) to create an empty output file when there are no cache entries
    to purge. Such behaviour was present in versions up to 0.14 and may
    be preferred by some to the new >= 1.5 versions behaviour. Thanks to
    Lee Yongjae ( @setup74 ) for the contribution.
  ! fix, signals.c: signals handling has been restructured in order to
    block certain signals during critical sections of data processing.
    Thanks to Vaibhav Phatarpekar ( @vphatarp ) for the contribution.
  ! fix, signals.c: slimmed reload() signal handler code and moved it to
    a synchronous section. The handler is to reset logging output to
    files or syslog. Thanks to Jared Mauch ( @jaredmauch ) for his
    support resolving this.
  ! fix, pmbgpd, pmbmpd and pmtelemetryd daemons: added extra signals
    handling (SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGCHLD) consistently to traffic daemons. 
  ! fix, BGP daemon: withdrawals of label-unicast (support introduced in
    1.7.3) and mpls-vpn NLRIs did fail to parse in release 1.7.3 and
    were silently discarded.
  ! fix, nfacctd: wired (BGP, BMP, ISIS, etc) lookups to NetFlow (Secure)
    Event Logging (NEL/NSEL). 
  ! fix, pmtelemetryd: re-implemented a decoder for so-called Cisco v1
    Streaming Telemetry proprietary header over UDP/TCP streams.
  ! fix, pmtelemetryd: improved sanitization of input JSON objects by
    also checking for isspace() other than isprint() for pretty-printed
    objects.
  ! maps_index: optimized lookups, improved debugging output upon loading
    indexes.
  ! fix, tee plugin: overwriting computed IP address length with socket
    container length was found to prevent output data on some BSDs.
  ! fix, kafka_common.c: if taking the p_kafka_close() route, ensure to
    return and not perform any further polling in order to avoid SEGVs.
  ! fix, BMP daemon: incorrect decoding of type was preventing correct
    logging of Init and Term messages extra info. Also in Term messages
    TLV data was incorrectly consumed twice triggering length check
    warnings. 
  ! fix, BMP daemon: added checks for successful BGP PDU parsing in both
    Peer Up (BGP OPEN) and Route Monitor (BGP UPDATE) messages.
  ! fix, BMP daemon: improved length checks and making sure that strings
    potentially non null-terminated are now terminated. Also TLV-related
    code has been refactored.
  ! fix, pmbgp.py: the example client for BGP Looking Glass was migrated
    to Python3: thanks to @brusilov for the contribution.
  ! fix, nfacctd: if src_port or dst_port primitives are selected, enable
    IP fragment handling. Needed to process L4 of IPFIX IE #351.
  ! fix, nfv9_template.c: correct handling of variable-length IPFIX
    fields. Thanks to Nimrod Mesika ( @nimrody ) for the contribution.
  ! fix, PostgreSQL plugin: ABSTIME was replaced with to_timestamp() in
    queries as support for ABSTIME was dropped as of PostgreSQL 12. Many
    thanks to Manuel Mendez ( @mmlb ) for the contribution.
  ! fix, PostgreSQL plugin: SEGVs were observed when the queue of pending
    queries was non-empty (ie. nfacctd_time_new set to false, default);
    thanks to Guo-Wei Su ( @nansenat16 ) for the contribution. 
  ! fix, cfg_handlers: [sn]facctd_disable_checks, nfacctd_disable_opt_
    scope_check could not be properly set to false.
  ! fix, sql_common.c: src_host_coords and dst_host_coords primitives
    have been correctly spaced in SQL queries. Also float values are now
    quoted. Finally, sampling_direction primitive is encoded correctly. 
  ! fix, kafka plugin: if kafka_avro_schema_registry is in use, subject
    name is aligned to Kafka topic name (if topic is not dynamic).
  ! fix, pretag.c: when using 'label', store the label string in the
    heap (instead of the stack). Thanks to Raphael P. Barazzutti
    ( @rbarazzutti ) for the contribution.
  ! fix, pretag.c: JEQ labels are now correctly free() during init upon
    map reload.
  ! fix, zmq_common.c: missing variable init in p_zmq_zap_handler() was
    causing plugin_pipe_zmq operations to fail on certain compilers (ie.
    gcc7). Thanks to Yuri Lachin ( @yuyutime ) for his support. 
  ! fix, cfg_handlers.c: reviewed handling of parsed 'zero' value for
    several config directives.
  ! fix, countless code warnings when enabling -Wall (--enable-debug);
    also included -Wall in Continuous Integration tests. Restructured
    globals, header inclusions, function prototypes definition, etc.  
    Many thanks to Marc Sune ( @msune ) for all his efforts.
  ! fix, configure.ac: evaluation of --enable-debug pushed to the end of
    the script so to not interfere with tests (ie. alignment, endianess,
    etc.).
  - BMP daemon: retired support for draft-hsmit-bmp-extensible-routemon-
    -msgs. 
  - AMQP plugin: obsoleted amqp_avro_schema feature (which includes
    amqp_avro_schema_routing_key and amqp_avro_schema_refresh_time keys
    config keys). Avro schemas can now only be written to files.

1.7.3 -- 16-05-2019
  + Introduced the RPKI daemon to build a ROA database and check prefixes
    validation status and coverages. Resource Public Key Infrastructure
    (RPKI) is a specialized public key infrastructure (PKI) framework
    designed to secure the Internet routing. RPKI uses certificates to
    allow Local Internet Registries (LIRs) to list the Internet number
    resources they hold. These attestations are called Route Origination
    Authorizations (ROAs). ROA information can be acquired in one of the
    two following ways: 1) importing it using the rpki_roas_file config
    directive from a file in the RIPE Validator format or 2) connecting
    to a RPKI RTR Cache for live ROA updates; the cache IP address/port
    being defined by the rpki_rtr_cache config directive (and a few more
    optional rpki_rtr_* directives are available and can be reviwed in
    the CONFIG-KEYS doc). The ROA fields will be populated with one of
    these five values: 'u' Unknown, 'v' Valid, 'i' Invalid no overlaps,
    'V' Invalid with a covering Valid prefix, 'U' Invalid with a covering
    Unknown prefix. Thanks to Job Snijders ( @job ) for his support and
    vision.
  + Introducing pmgrpcd.py, written in Python, a daemon to handle gRPC-
    based Streaming Telemetry sessions and unmarshall GPB data. Code
    was mostly courtesy by Matthias Arnold ( @tbearma1 ). This is in
    addition (or feeding into) pmtelemetryd, written in C, a daemon to
    handle TCP/UDP-based Streaming Telemetry sessions with JSON-encoded
    data. Thanks to Matthias Arnold ( @tbearma1 ) and Thomas Graf for
    their support and contributing code. 
  + pmacctd, uacctd: added support for CFP (Cisco FabricPath) and Cisco
    Virtual Network Tag protocols. Both patches were courtesy by Stephen
    Clark ( @sclark46 ). 
  + print plugin: added 'custom' to print_output. This is to cover two
    main use-cases: 1) use JSON or Avro encodings but fix the format of
    the messages in a custom way and 2) use a different encoding than
    JSON or Avro. See also example in examples/custom and new directives
    print_output_custom_lib and print_output_custom_cfg_file. The patch
    was courtesy by Edge Intelligence ( @edge-intelligence ).
  + Introducing mpls_pw_id aggregation primitive and mpls_pw_id key in
    pre_tag_map to filter on signalled L2 MPLS VPN Pseudowire IDs.
  + BGP daemon: added bgp_disable_router_id knob to enable/disable BGP
    Router-ID check, both at BGP OPEN time and BGP lookup. Useful, for
    example, in scenarios with split BGP v4/v6 AFs over v4/v6 transports.
  + BGP, BMP daemons: translate origin attribute numeric value into IGP
    (i), EGP (e) and Incomplete (u) strings.
  + plugins: added new plugin_exit_any feature to make the daemon bail
    out if any (not all, which is the default behaviour) of the plugins
    exits.
  + maps_index: improved selection of buckets for index hash structure
    by picking the closest prime number to the double of the entries of
    the map to be indexed in order to achieve better elements dispersion
    and hence better performances.
  + nfacctd: added support for IPFIX templateId-scoped (IE 145) sampling
    information.
  + pmacctd, uacctd, sfacctd, nfacctd: added a -M command-line option to
    set *_markers (ie. print_markers) to true and fixed -A command-line
    option to set print_output_file_append to align to true/false.
  ! fix, BGP, BMP, Streaming Telemetry daemons: improved sequencing of
    dump events by assigning a single sequence number per event (ie. for
    streaming pipeline scenarios in order to reduce correlation with
    dump_init/dump_close messages). Also amount of record dumped was
    added to the close message.
  ! fix, BGP, BMP, Streaming Telemetry daemons: removed hierarchical
    json_decref() since json_object_get() borrows reference. This was
    occasionaly leading to SEGVs.
  ! fix, uacctd: dynamically allocate jumbo_container buffer size as
    packets larger than 10KB, previous static allocation, would lead to
    crashes.
  ! fix, nfacctd: wired (BGP, BMP, ISIS, etc.) lookups to the NEL/NSEL 
    use-case.  
  ! fix, nfacctd: search for IE 408 (dataLinkFrameType) was leading to
    SEGVs. Also improved handling of variable-length IPFIX templates.  
  ! fix, BMP daemon: solved an occasional truncation of the last message
    in a packet. 
  ! fix, BGP daemon: when processing bgp_daemon_md5_file, ipv4 addresses
    were incorrectly translated to ipv4-mapped ipv6 ones as a result of
    which TCP-MD5 hashes were not correctly bound to sockets.
  ! fix, BGP daemon: improved label-unicast and mpls-vpn SAFIs handling
    (some bogus messages, multiple labels, etc.).
  ! fix, BGP daemon: introduced PREFIX_STRLEN to make enough room for
    prefix2str() calls (before unsufficient INET6_ADDRSTRLEN was used).
  ! fix, BMP daemon: improved handling of ADD-PATH capability.
  ! fix, plugins: an incorrect evaluation in P_cache_attach_new_node did
    make possible to buffer overrun in plugins cache allocation. This was
    found related to a "[..]: Assertion `!cache_ptr->stitch' failed."
    daemon bail-out message.
  ! fix, plugins: if pidfile directive was enabled, exit_gracefully() was
    mistakenly deleting the plugin pidfile when called by a child process
    (ie. writer, dumper, etc.).
  ! fix, plugins: when taking exit_gracefully(), if the process is marked
    as 'is_forked', just exit and don't perform extra ops in exit_all()
    or exit_plugin().
  ! fix, plugins: re-evaluate dynamic tables/files name if *_refresh_time
    is different than *_history period.
  ! fix, SQL plugins: a missing 'AND' was making SQL statements related
    to src_host_coords and dst_host_coords fail.
  ! fix, GeoIPv2: if no match is returned by libmaxminddb, return O1 code
    (Other Country) instead of a null value.
  ! fix, flow_to_rd_map: mpls_vpn_id was not working when maps_index was
    enabled. Also partly re-written mpls_vpn_id handler.
  ! fix, nfprobe plugin: serialize_bin() function introduced for correct
    serialization of custom primitives defined with 'raw' semantics.
  ! fix, PostgreSQL plugin: testing for presence of PQlibVersion() in
    libpq to prevent compiling issues (ie. on CentOS 6).
  ! fix, MySQL plugin: including mysql_version.h to compile successfully
    against newer MariaDB releases.
  ! fix, nDPI classification: send log message if 'class' primitive is
    selected but nDPI is not compiled in; also updated code to follow
    API changes in versions >= 2.6 of the library. Dropped support for
    versions < 2.4.  
  ! fix, sfprobe plugin: added (and documented) conditional for optional
    export of classification info.
  ! fix, aggregate_primitives: field_type is now also allowed for pmacctd
    and uaccd daemons so that it can be used for NetFlow v9/IPFIX export
    (nfprobe plugin) purposes.
  ! fix, pre_tag_map: if no 'ip' keyword is specified, an entry of the
    map gets recirculated in order to be set for both v4 and v6 maps. If
    a 'set_label' is also specified, it was causing a SEGV. Now the label
    is correctly copied in case of recirculation. 
  ! fix, zmq_common.c: added option for non-blocking p_zmq_send_bin() as
    otherwise program would block in case of no consumers (main use-case:
    flow replication over ZeroMQ queues); as a result, a generous hwm
    value was added on both sides of these queues.
  ! fix, zmq_common.c: ZAP socket moved inside thread to prevent failed
    assert() when compiling with gcc7/gcc8. Also a single user/password
    auto-generated combination is used for all plugins.
  ! fix, signals.c: SIGUSR1 handler for nfacctd and nfacctd is changed to
    syncronous in order to prevent race conditions. Also, in pmacctd,
    upon sending SIGUSR1, stats were not printed when reading packets
    from a pcap_interfaaces_map.
  ! fix, plugin_cmn_json.c: if leaving protocols numerical (ie. proto,
    tunnel_proto primitives), convert them to string-represented numbers
    for data consistency for consumers.
  ! fix, util.c: open_output_file(), if file exists and it's a FIFO then
    set O_NONBLOCK when opening.
  ! fix, pretag.c: pretag_index_report() was reporting incorrect info of
    the hash structure built for the maps_index feature. Its format was
    has also changed to be better parseable.
  ! fix, compile time warnings: several warnings were addressed including
    but not restricted to -Wformat ones. Also an annotation was added to
    the Log function to inform the compiler it's a printf-style function,
    allowing it to give warnings for argument mismatches.
  - --enable-ipv6 configure script switch has been deprecated and, as a
    result, IPv6 support was made mandatory.
  - BGP daemon: removed unused pathlimit field from bgp_attr structure.
  - pmacct client: removed deprecated SYM field from from formatted and
    CSV headers.

1.7.2 -- 26-11-2018
  + nfacctd, sfacctd: added Kafka broker among the options to receive
    NetFlow/IPFIX, sFlow data from. Host, port and topic should all be
    specified along with an optional config file to pass to librdkafka.
  + nfacctd, sfacctd, pmtelemetryd: added ZeroMQ queue among the options
    to receive NetFlow/IPFIX, sFlow or Streaming Telemetry data from. An
    IP address and port should be specified.
  + nfacctd, sfacctd: added sampling_direction to the set of supported
    primitives, valid values being ingress, egress and unknown.
  + nfacctd, sfacctd: stats, ie. amount of NetFlow/IPFIX or sFlow packets
    received per router, are now available when in tee mode. Stats can be
    retrieved via a SIGUSR1 UNIX signal.
  + pcap_savefile_replay: a feature to replay content for the specified
    amounf of time when reading from a pcap_savefile.
  + pre_tag_map: added several new keys: src_net and dst_net (to tag on
    source and destination IP prefixes respectively), bgp_nexthop (to
    tag on BGP nexthop) and nat_event.
  + BGP daemon: added bgp_lrgcomm_pattern feature to filter large BGP
    communities (in addition to existing equivalent knobs to filter on
    standard and extended communities).
  + BMP, Streaming Telemetry daemons: msglog_file and dump_file config
    directives now offer $bmp_router, $bmp_router_port, $telemetry_node
    and $telemetry_node_port variables.
  + BGP, BMP, Streaming Telemetry daemons: added BGP, BMP and Streaming
    Telemetry exporter TCP/UDP port as variable for dump/log filenames
    (to better support NAT traversal scenarios).
  + BGP, BMP daemons: added message sequencing to both BGP and BMP dumps
    (bgp_table_dump_*, bmp_dump_*). If dumping and logging are enabled
    in parallel then sequencing the dumps allows for check pointing at
    regular time intervals.
  + BMP daemon: implemented draft-hsmit-bmp-extensible-routemon-msgs for
    a tlv-based encoding of route-monitoring messages with a new message
    type.  
  + Streaming Telemetry daemon: added sample decoders for gRPC / GPB for
    Cisco and Huawei platforms, written in Python. Telemetry data is
    decoded using vendor-supplied proto files and output in JSON format
    in a ZeroMQ queue - suitable for ingestion in pmtelemetryd. Docs and
    sample code is available in the telemetry/ directory. This is all in
    addition to TCP/UDP transports and JSON encoding supported natively
    in pmtelemetryd.
  + kafka plugin: introduced support for Confluent Schema Registry via
    libserdes. A registry can be supplied via kafka_avro_schema_registry
    config directive; the schema is generated automatically. The feature
    enables validation of data passed through a Kafka broker and uses
    Avro encoding. 
  + kafka plugin: added $in_iface key (input interface) to the set of
    variables supported by kafka_partition_key. Extremely useful when
    coupled to $peer_src_ip in some scenarios. 
  + print, IMT plugins: separator for CSV format can now be space (\s)
    or tab (\t).
  + tee plugin: added Kafka broker among the emitters. kafka_broker and
    kafka_topic knobs are now available in the tee_receivers map and a
    tee_kafka_config_file directive allows to define a file with config
    to pass to librdkafka.
  + tee plugin: added ZeroMQ queue among the emitters. zmq_address knob
    defines the queue IP address and port to emit to.
  + tee plugin: introducing support for complex pre_tag_map when doing
    replication of NetFlow/IPFIX (sFlow replication had already this).
    With this feature flows are individually evaluated against supplied
    filters (input interface, BGP next-hop, etc.) and (not) replicated
    accordingly.
  + GeoIP v2: added support for latitude and longitude primitives via
    src_host_coords and dst_host_coords knobs. This is in addition to
    existing country and pocode supports.
  + files_uid, files_gid: now also user and group strings are accepted.
    This is in addition to user and group IDs.
  ! fix, nfacctd: NF_evaluate_flow_type() improved to not detect Cisco
    ASA flows (ie. those including initiator and responder octets) as
    events. Also improved sanity checking of received NetFlow v9/IPFIX
    data and options templates and reviwed modulo functions and improved
    template hashing.
  ! fix, BGP, BMP, Streaming Telemetry daemons: improved log sequencing
    by handling counter wrap-up more gracefully. Also a log sequencing
    API was developed to improve code re-use. 
  ! fix, BGP daemon: added check for duplicate Router-IDs at BGP OPEN
    parsing time. If a duplicate is detected, the session BGP OPENing of
    the new session is dropped.
  ! fix, BGP daemon: ADD-PATH capability was checked only in the first
    AFI/SAFI and was being set in the reply for last AFI/SAFI RECEIVE(1)
    if first included SEND(2) or SEND-RECEIVE(3). Thanks to Markus Weber
    ( @FvDxxx ) for his patch.
  ! fix, BGP daemon: upon route lookup, don't perform ADD-PATH logics if
    no PATH-ID (even if ADD-PATH capability is announced by the peer).
    Thanks to Camilo Cardona ( @jccardonar ) for his support solving the
    issue.
  ! fix, BGP daemon: graceful handling of invalid AS-PATH segment types
    (ie. AS-PATH in BGP UPDATE inconsistent with capabilities passed in
    BGP OPEN) in order to avoid SEGVs.
  ! fix, pmtelemetryd: improved support for UDP timeouts. Also reviewed
    natively supported encodings: removed zjson and GPB was moved to pre-
    processors (with samples available in telemetry/decoders directory). 
  ! fix, pmtelemetryd: no dump_init / dump_close events sequencing since
    all messages are sequenced anyway (consistency with other daemons).
  ! fix, kafka_common.c: now destroying both config and topic config as
    part of p_kafka_close() in order to avoid memory leaks. Also, port is
    omitted from broker string if not passed to p_kafka_set_broker(). And
    finally output queue length checks in p_kafka_check_outq_len() have
    been relaxed (to counter temporary hickups that need more patience). 
  ! fix, kafka plugin: kafka_partition default was zero (that is, a valid
    partition number) instead of -1 (RD_KAFKA_PARTITION_UA or unassigned)
    which allows librdkafka to attach a partitioner.
  ! fix, SQL plugins: sql_table_schema is honoured even if sql_table_name
    is non-dynamic. This is to cover cases where the table is rotated
    externally.
  ! fix, mysql plugin: my_bool replaced with bool. The plugin now does
    compile against MySQL 8.0. Also added inclusion of stdbool.h as on
    some systems bool is not defined. Improved overall probing for MySQL
    headers. 
  ! fix, pgsql plugin: sql_recovery_backup_host was not being honoured.
    PG_create_backend() now composes a proper conn_string.
  ! fix, print plugin: increase successful queries number, QN, only if
    the output file was successfully opened.
  ! fix, zmq_common.c: moved ZAP socket initialization inside the ZAP
    handler. See: https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/issues/3313 .
  ! fix, util.c: length checks in handle_dynname_internal_strings() were
    reviewed. Existings were not working in absence of starting/trailing
    non-variable strings.
  ! fix, util.c: use lockf() instead of more problematic flock(). Thanks
    to Yuri Lachin ( @yuyutime ) and Miki Takata ( @mikiT ) for their
    support.
  ! fix, util.c: in compose_timestamp() pad usecs and use "%ld" since
    time fields are signed longs. Thanks to @raymondrussell for the
    patch.
  ! fix, ndpi_util.c: a protocol bitmask is now set in order to increase
    match rate. Patch is courtesy by @rsolsn.
  ! fix, compile time warnings: several warnings were addressed including
    but not restricted to -Wreturn-time, -Wunused-variable, implicit func
    declarations, -Wformat-extra-args, -Wunused-label, -Wunused-value,
    -Wunused-function, sbrk calls, -Wpointer-to-int-cast, -Wparentheses
    and -Wint-to-pointer-cast.
  ! fix, dangerous uninitialized values: net_aggr.c, pmacct.c: in merge()
    argument with non-NULL attribute could be passed NULL; bmp_msg.c: in
    bmp_process_msg_route_monitor() bdata.tstamp could be uninitialized;
    sfprobe_plugin.c: calloc() return value (possibly null) was not being
    checked; sflow_agent.c: uninitialized ret value in sfl_agent_init()
    could lead to undefined bind() error behaviour.
  ! fix, thread_pool.c: reviewed logics in deallocate_thread_pool() and
    solved a minor memory leak in allocate_thread_pool().
  - pmacctd: removed support for FDDI :)
  - nfacctd: discontinued support for NetFlow v1, v7 and v8 collection
    and replication.
  - pre_tag_map: matching on 'sampling_rate' is not supported anymore as
    a sampling_rate primitive is now available; the 'return' feature to
    return matched data before completing the map workflow has started
    being obsoleted (retired from docs but still available).
  - plugin_pipe_check_core_pid: deprecating feature given RabbitMQ and
    Kafka are not supported anymore for internal message delivery.
  - tee plugin: obsoleted tee_dissect_send_full_pkt knob, entire packets
    are now replicated only if no pre_tag_map or a simple pre_tag_map is
    defined.
  - nfprobe plugin: removed support for NetFlow v1 export.

1.7.1 -- 06-05-2018
  + pmbgpd: introduced a BGP x-connect feature meant to map BGP peers
    (ie. PE routers) to BGP collectors (ie. nfacctd, sfacctd) via a
    standalone BGP daemon (pmbgpd). The aim is to facilitate operations
    when re-sizing/re-balancing the collection infrastructure without
    impacting (ie. re-configuring) BGP peers. bgp_daemon_xconnect_map
    expects full pathname to a file where cross-connects are defined;
    mapping works only against the IP source address and not the BGP
    Router ID, only 1:1 relationships can be formed (ie. this is about
    cross-connecting, not replication) and only one session per BGP
    peer is supported (ie. multiple BGP agents are running on the same
    IP address or NAT traversal scenarios are not supported [yet]).
    A sample map is provided in 'examples/bgp_xconnects.map.example'.
  + pmbgpd: introduced a BGP Looking Glass server allowing to perform
    queries, ie. lookup of IP addresses/prefixes or get the list of BGP
    peers, against available BGP RIBs. The server is asyncronous and
    uses ZeroMQ as transport layer to serve incoming queries. Sample
    C/Python LG clients are available in 'examples/lg'. A sample LG
    server config is available in QUICKSTART. Request/Reply Looking
    Glass formats are documented in 'docs/LOOKING_GLASS_FORMAT'.
  + pmacctd: a single daemon can now listen for traffic on multiple
    interfaces via a polling mechanism. This can be configured via a
    pcap_interfaces_map feature (interface/pcap_interface can still be
    used for backward compatiblity to listen on a single interface). The
    map allows to define also ifindex mapping and capturing direction on
    a per-interface basis. The map can be reloaded at runtime via a USR2
    signal and a sample map is in examples/pcap_interfaces.map.example.
  + Kafka plugin: dynamic partitioning via kafka_partition_dynamic and
    kafka_partition_key knobs is introduced. The Kafka topic can contain
    variables, ie. $peer_src_ip, $src_host, $dst_port, $tag, etc., which
    are all computed when data is purged to the backend. This feature is
    in addition to the existing kafka_partition feature which allows to
    rely on the built-in Kafka partitioning to assign data statically to
    one partition or rely dynamically on the default partitioner. The
    feature is courtesy by Corentin Neau / Codethink ( @weyfonk ).
  + Introduced rfc3339 formatted timestamps: in logs, ie. UTC timezone
    represented as yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss(.ss)Z; for aggregation primitives
    the timestamps_rfc3339 knob can be used to enable this feature (left
    disabled by default for backward compatibility).
  + timestamps_utc: new knob to decode timestamps to UTC timezone even
    if the Operating System is set to a different timezone. On the goods
    of running a system set to UTC please read Q18 of FAQS.
  + sfacctd: implemented mpls_label_top, mpls_label_bottom and
    mpls_stack_depth primitives decoded from sFlow flow sample headers.
    Thanks to David Barroso ( @dbarrosop ) for his support.
  + nfacctd: added support for IEs 130 (exporterIPv4Address) and 131
    (exporterIPv6Address) when passed as part of NetFlow v9/IPFIX
    option packets (these IEs were already supported when passed in flow
    data). Also added support for IE 351 (dataLinkFrameSection) which
    carries the initial portion of a sampled raw packet headers (a-la
    sFlow). This was tested working against a Cisco NCS 5k platform.
  + nfprobe plugin: added a new nfprobe_dont_cache knob allowing to
    disable caching and summarisation of flows (essentially letting the
    NetFlow/IPFIX probe behave like a sFlow probe).
  + nfprobe plugin: added support for MPLS_LABEL_1, NetFlow v9/IPFIX IE
    70; improved support for BGP next-hop IE 18 and 63. Also support for
    IE 130/131 vi NetFlow v9/IPFIX Options was added.
  + sfprobe plugin: added sfprobe_source_ip knob to define the local IP
    address from which sFlow datagrams are exported; improved support
    for BGP next-hop.
  + nfacctd, sfacctd, BGP, BMP, Streaming Telemetry daemons: on Linux,
    if supported, use SO_REUSEPORT for the listening socket (added to
    existing SO_REUSEADDR option).
  + nfacctd, sfacctd: introduced new 'export_proto_sysid' primitive to
    give visibility to NetFlow v5/v8 engine_id / NetFlow v9 source ID /
    IPFIX Obs Domain ID / sFlow agentSubID.
  + nfacctd, sfacctd: extended nDPI support to NetFlow v9/IPFIX packets
    with IE 315 (dataLinkFrameSection) and sFlow v5 packets with header
    section.
  + nfacctd, sfacctd: extended custom primitives definition framework,
    aggregate_primitives, to NetFlow v9/IPFIX packets with IE 315
    (dataLinkFrameSection) and sFlow v5 sampled headers section.
  + nfacctd, sfacctd: added per-collector packets and bytes counts to
    stats emitted via SIGUSR1. Also the output was made more formal (so
    to be more easily parsed) and is documented in the UPGRADE notes. 
  + nfacctd, pmacctd, sfacctd: pcap_savefile_delay feature introduced
    to sleep for the supplied amount of seconds before playing a given
    pcap_savefile. Useful, for example, to let BGP/BMP sessions come up
    so that routing data is available for correlation when processing
    data in the trace.
  + Kafka plugin: configuring statistics.interval.ms to a positive value
    in a kafka_config_file makes now librdkafka log plenty of internal
    metrics.
  + BGP daemon: added support for Extended BGP Administrative Shutdown
    Communication (draft-snijders-idr-rfc8203bis-00).
  + BMP daemon: added support for draft-ietf-grow-bmp-adj-rib-out-01 and
    draft-ietf-grow-bmp-loc-rib-01. As a result of that, Route Monitor
    log messages now contain indication of is_out and is_filtered.
  + BMP daemon: added support for stats reports 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 and 
    descriptions for the different Peer Types and and Peer Down reasons.
    Finally, indication of is_post is now making to Route Monitor log
    messages. 
  + plugin_pipe_zmq: introduced plugin_pipe_zmq_hwm (high water mark)
    knob to control the maximum amount of messages than can be stored in
    the ZeroMQ queue.
  + [ns]facctd_allow_file: the map is now made reloadable at runtime via
    SIGUSR2 and accepts IPv4/IPv6 prefixes increasing its scale (before
    it was only accepting individual IP addresses).
  + pmacctd: added support for IPv6, MPLS for DLT_LINUX_SLL captures.
    Thanks to David Barroso ( @dbarrosop ) for his support.
  + uacctd: added a global 'direction' knob to give visibility of data
    capturing direction, ie. in/out. Useful for pre_tag_map use.
  + MySQL plugin: added sql_port knob in order to specify non-default
    ports for connecting to the database. Patch is courtesy by Vadim
    Tkachenko ( @vadimtk ).
  ! fix, plugins: getppid() parent process health check improved so
    to work in Docker environments not assuming anymore parent PID is
    1. Patch is courtesy by Hidde van der Heide ( @hvanderheide ). 
  ! fix, plugins: imposing a budget for received messages (100) so to
    preserve fairness of other operations (ie. time keeping, bucketing,
    reloading maps, etc.) and prevent starvations.
  ! fix, plugins: retry when zmq_getsockopt() for ZMQ_EVENTS returns
    EINTR. Thanks to Wouter de Jong for his support solving the issue.
  ! fix, plugins: when executing triggers, the first argument passed to
    execv() should be the path to the invoked executable to prevent
    execv(3) to fail and return EFAULT on OpenBSD. Patch is courtesy
    by @higgsd.
  ! fix, BGP daemon: improved support of multiple capabilities per
    optional parameter in the OPEN message. Also add-path capability is
    now advertised if neighbor supports send/receive (previously it was
    sent back on send only) of such capability. Thanks to Radu Anghel
    ( @cozonac ) for his support.
  ! fix, BGP daemon: upon route lookup, don't perform ADD-PATH logics if
    no PATH-ID (even if ADD-PATH capability is announced by the peer).
    Thanks to Camilo Cardona ( @jccardonar ) for his support solving the
    issue.
  ! fix, BGP daemon: wrong type 2 32-bit ASN Route Distinguisher was
    defined in network.h. Thanks to Thomas Graf for reporting the issue.
  ! fix, BGP, BMP daemons: lookup of BGP-LU entries is now performed
    against the correct RIB.
  ! fix, BMP daemon: the BMP thread is now made mutually exclusive with
    the BGP one (until an use-case needs to run them both). This is to
    potentially prevent BGP and BMP information to interfere with each
    other when correlated. Also the 'bmp' keyword was added for *_as and
    *_net config directives (ie. nfacctd_as, nfacctd_net). Thanks to
    Juan Camilo Cardona ( @jccardonar ) for his support.
  ! fix, BMP daemon: improved correlation of BMP data with traffic data
    by supporting a replication use-case (the BMP exporter is a route
    -server rather than an actual Edge Router) upon lookup. Thanks to
    Juan Camilo Cardona ( @jccardonar ) for his support.
  ! fix, BMP daemon: in bgp_peer_cmp() and bgp_peer_host_addr_cmp() the
    comparison function has been changed from generic memcmp() to a more
    specific host_addr_cmp() as paddings were giving issues. Thanks to
    Juan Camilo Cardona ( @jccardonar ) for reporting the issue.
  ! fix, BMP daemon: a pm_tdestroy call in bmp_peer_close() was leading
    to SEGV under certain conditions by not NULL'ing all pointers. Thanks
    to Juan Camilo Cardona ( @jccardonar ) for reporting the issue.
  ! fix, nfacctd: prevent time calculations to underflow in cases in
    which sysUptime < first or last flow switched timestamps in NetFlow
    v5. Patch is courtesy by David Steinn Geirsson ( @dsgwork ). 
  ! fix, nfacctd: in the context of aggregate_primitives, now enforcing
    terminating the zero when decoding variable-length IEs when applying
    string semantics.
  ! fix, nfprobe: changed ifIndex fields from u_int16_t to u_int32_t in
    order to prevent overflows and aligning to the rest of structs.
  ! fix, MySQL plugin: minor code revisions to restore compiling against
    MariaDB 10.2. 
  ! fix, sql_common.c: increased read_SQLquery_from_file() buffer size
    so that sql_table_schema can be fed with longer CREATE TABLE
    statements.
  ! fix, print, SQL plugins: post_tag, post_tag2 support was added to
    sql_table and print_output_file. Also for Kafka, RabbitMQ plugins
    kafka_topic and amqp_routing_key variables support was harmonized
    with print and SQL plugins (ie. $pre_tag renamed to $tag), see
    UPGRADE notes.
  ! fix, SQL plugins: sql_startup_delay was not being honored when
    sql_trigger_exec was defined without a sql_trigger_time resulting
    in empty environment variables being passed to the triggered script.
    Thanks to Johannes Maybaum for his support resolving the issue.
  ! fix, pkt_handlers.c: tmp_asa_bi_flow value was ignored when applied
    to a specific plugin.
  ! fix, util.c: when data timestamp is not available, dynamic file and
    table names variables were populated with a 1-Jan-1970 date. Now the
    current timestamp is used instead as last resort. Patch is courtesy
    by Ivan F. Martinez ( @ivanfmartinez ).
  ! fix, addr.c: host_addr_mask_sa_cmp() and str_to_addr_mask() network
    mask computation for IPv6 addresses was wrong. allow_file feature
    was affected.
  ! fix, build system: several patches committed to the build system to
    simplify libraries probing, make sure to bail out upon error. Also
    now a minimum required version is imposed to almost all libraries.
  - --enable-threads / --disable-threads: removed the configure switch
    that was allowing to compile pmacct even when no pthreads library was
    available on a system. From now on support for threads is mandatory.
  - BGP daemon: offline code, ie. bgp_daemon_offline_* config directives,
    has been deprecated in favor of other approaches, ie. BGP Looking
    Glass and BGP Xconnects.
  - pkt_len_distrib: the primitive, which was meant to bucket packet /
    flow / sample lengths in a distribution has been obsoleted. 

1.7.0 -- 21-10-2017
  + ZeroMQ integration: by defining plugin_pipe_zmq to 'true', ZeroMQ is
    used for queueing between the Core Process and plugins. This is in
    alternative to the home-grown circular queue implementation (ie.
    plugin_pipe_size). plugin_pipe_zmq_profile can be set to one value
    of { micro, small, medium, large, xlarge } and allows to select
    among a few standard buffering profiles without having to fiddle
    with plugin_buffer_size. How to compile, install and operate ZeroMQ
    is documented in the "Internal buffering and queueing" section of
    the QUICKSTART document. 
  + nDPI integration: enables packet classification, replacing existing
    L7-layer project integration, and is available for pmacctd and
    uacctd. The feature, once nDPI is compiled in, is simply enabled by
    specifying 'class' as part of the aggregation method. How to compile
    install and operate nDPI is documented in the "Quickstart guide to
    packet classification" section of the QUICKSTART document.
  + nfacctd: introduced nfacctd_templates_file so that NetFlow v9/IPFIX
    templates can be cached to disk to limit the amount of lost packets
    due to unknown templates when nfacctd (re)starts. The implementation
    is courtesy by Codethink Ltd. 
  + nfacctd: introduced support for PEN on IPFIX option templates. This
    is in addition to already supported PEN for data templates. Thanks
    to Gilad Zamoshinski ( @zamog ) for his support. 
  + sfacctd: introduced new aggregation primitives (tunnel_src_host,
    tunnel_dst_host, tunnel_proto, tunnel_tos) to support inner L3
    layers. Thanks to Kaname Nishizuka ( @__kaname__ ) for his support.
  + nfacctd, sfacctd: pcap_savefile and pcap_savefile_wait were ported
    from pmacctd. They allow to process NetFlow/IPFIX and sFlow data
    from previously captured packets; these also ease some debugging by
    not having to resort anymore to tcpreplay for most cases.
  + pmacctd, sfacctd: nfacctd_time_new feature has been ported so, when
    historical accounting is enabled, to allow to choose among capture
    time and time of receipt at the collector for time-binning.
  + nfacctd: added support for NetFlow v9/IPFIX field types #130/#131,
    respectively the IPv4/IPv6 address of the element exporter.
  + nfacctd: introduced nfacctd_disable_opt_scope_check: mainly a work
    around to implementations not encoding NetFlow v9/IPIFX option scope
    correctly, this knob allows to disable option scope checking. Thanks
    to Gilad Zamoshinski ( @zamog ) for his support.
  + pre_tag_map: added 'source_id' key for tagging on NetFlow v9/IPFIX
    source_id field. Added also 'fwdstatus' for tagging on NetFlow v9/
    IPFIX information element #89: this implementation is courtesy by
    Emil Palm ( @mrevilme ).
  + tee plugin: tagging is now possible on NetFlow v5-v8 engine_type/
    engine_id, NetFlow v9/IPFIX source_id and sFlow AgentId.
  + tee plugin: added support for 'src_port' in tee_receivers map. When
    in non-transparent replication mode, use the specified UDP port to
    send data to receiver(s). This is in addition to tee_source_ip,
    which allows to set a configured IP address as source.
  + networks_no_mask_if_zero: a new knob so that IP prefixes with zero
    mask - that is, unknown ones or those hitting a default route - are
    not masked. The feature applies to *_net aggregation primitives and
    makes sure individual IP addresses belonging to unknown IP prefixes
    are not zeroed out.
  + networks_file: hooked up networks_file_no_lpm feature to peer and
    origin ASNs and (BGP) next-hop fields.
  + pmacctd: added support for calling pcap_set_protocol() if supported
    by libpcap. Patch is courtesy by Lennert Buytenhek ( @buytenh ).
  + pmbgpd, pmbmpd, pmtelemetryd: added a few CL options to ease output
    of BGP, BMP and Streaming Telemetry data, for example: -o supplies
    a b[gm]p_daemon_msglog_file, -O supplies a b[gm]p_dump_file and -i
    supplies b[gm]p_dump_refresh_time.
  + kafka plugin: in the examples section, added a Kafka consumer script
    using the performing confluent-kafka-python module. 
  ! fix, BGP daemon: segfault with add-path enabled peers as per issue
    #128. Patch is courtesy by Markus Weber ( @FvDxxx ).
  ! fix, print plugin: do not update link to latest file if cause of
    purging is a safe action (ie. cache space is finished. Thanks to
    Camilo Cardona ( @jccardonar ) for reporting the issue. Also, for
    the same reason, do not execute triggers (ie. print_trigger_exec). 
  ! fix, nfacctd: improved IP protocol check in NF_evaluate_flow_type()
    A missing length check was causing, under certain conditions, some
    flows to be marked as IPv6. Many thanks to Yann Belin for his
    support resolving the issue.
  ! fix, print and SQL plugins: optimized the cases when the dynamic
    filename/table has to be re-evaluated. This results in purge speed
    gains when the dynamic part is time-related and nfacctd_time_new is
    set to true.
  ! fix, bgp_daemon_md5_file: if the server socket is AF_INET and the
    compared peer address in MD5 file is AF_INET6 (v4-mapped v6), pass
    it through ipv4_mapped_to_ipv4(). Also if the server socket is
    AF_INET6 and the compared peer addess in MD5 file is AF_INET, pass
    it through ipv4_to_ipv4_mapped(). Thanks to Paul Mabey for reporting
    the issue.
  ! fix, nfacctd: improved length checks in resolve_vlen_template() to
    prevent SEGVs. Thanks to Josh Suhr and Levi Mason for their support.
  ! fix, nfacctd: flow stitching, improved flow end time checks. Thanks
    to Fabio Bindi ( @FabioLiv ) for his support resolving the issue.
  ! fix, amqp_common.c: amqp_persistent_msg now declares the RabbitMQ
    exchange as durable in addition to marking messages as persistent;
    this is related to issue #148.
  ! fix, nfacctd: added flowset count check to existing length checks 
    for NetFlow v9/IPFIX datagrams. This is to avoid logs flooding in
    case of padding. Thanks to Steffen Plotner for reporting the issue.
  ! fix, BGP daemon: when dumping BGP data at regular time intervals,
    dump_close message contained wrongly formatted timestamp. Thanks to
    Yuri Lachin for reporting the issue.
  ! fix, MySQL plugin: if --enable-ipv6 and sql_num_hosts set to true,
    use INET6_ATON for both v4 and v6 addresses. Thanks to Guy Lowe
    ( @gunkaaa ) for reporting the issue and his support resolving it.
  ! fix, 'flows' primitive: it has been wired to sFlow so to count Flow
    Samples received. This is to support Q21 in FAQS document.
  ! fix, BGP daemon: Extended Communities value was printed with %d
    (signed) format string instead of %u (unsigned), causing issue on
    large values.
  ! fix, aggregate_primitives: improved support of 'u_int' semantics for
    8 bytes integers. This is in addition to already supported 1, 2 and
    4 bytes integers.
  ! fix, pidfile: pidfile created by plugin processes was not removed.
    Thanks to Yuri Lachin for reporting the issue.
  ! fix, print plugin: checking non-null file descriptor before setvbuf
    in order to prevent SEGV. Similar checks were added to prevent nulls
    be input to libavro calls when Apache Avro output is selected.
  ! fix, SQL plugins: MPLS aggregation primitives were not correctly
    activated in case sql_optimize_clauses was set to false.
  ! fix, building system: reviewed minimum requirement for libraries,
    removed unused m4 macros, split features in plugins (ie. MySQL) and
    supports (ie. JSON).
  ! fix, sql_history: it now correctly honors periods expressed is 's'
    seconds.
  ! fix, BGP daemon: rewritten bgp_peer_print() to be thread safe.
  ! fix, pretag.h: addressed compiler warning on 32-bit architectures,
    integer constant is too large for "long" type. Thanks to Stephen
    Clark ( @sclark46 ) for reporting the issue.
  - MongoDB plugin: it is being discontinued since the old Mongo API is
    not supported anymore and there has never been enough push from the
    community to transition to the new/current API (which would require
    a rewrite of most of the plugin). In this phase-1 the existing
    MongoDB plugin is still available using 'plugins: mongodb_legacy'
    in the configuration.
  - Packet classification basing on the L7-filter project is being
    discontinued (ie. 'classifiers' directive). This is being replaced
    by an implementation basing on the nDPI project. As part of this
    also the sql_aggressive_classification knob has been discontinued.
  - tee_receiver was part of the original implementation of the tee
    plugin, allowing to forward to a single target and hence requiring
    multiple plugins instantiated, one per target. Since 0.14.3 this
    directive was effectively outdated by tee_receivers.
  - tmp_net_own_field: the knob has been discontinued and was allowing
    to revert to backward compatible behaviour of IP prefixes (ie.
    src_net) being written in the same field as IP addresses (ie.
    src_host).
  - tmp_comms_same_field: the knob has been discontinued and was
    allowing to revert to backward compatible behaviour of BGP
    communities (standard and extended) being writeen all in the same
    field.
  - plugin_pipe_amqp and plugin_pipe_kafka features were meant as an
    alternative to the homegrown queue solution for internal messaging,
    ie. passing data from the Core Process to Plugins, and are being
    discontinued. They are being replaced by a new implementation,
    plugin_pipe_zmq, basing on ZeroMQ.
  - plugin_pipe_backlog was allowing to keep an artificial backlog of
    data in the Core Process so to maximise bypass poll() syscalls in
    plugins. If home-grown queueing is found limiting, instead of
    falling back to such strategies, ZeroMQ queueing should be used.
  - pmacctd: deprecated support for legacy link layers: FDDI, Token Ring
    and HDLC.

1.6.2 -- 21-04-2017
  + BGP, BMP daemons: introduced support for BGP Large Communities IETF
    draft (draft-ietf-idr-large-community). Large Communities are stored
    in a variable-length field. Thanks to Job Snijders ( @job ) for his
    support.
  + BGP daemon: implemented draft-ietf-idr-shutdown. The draft defines a
    mechanism to transmit a short freeform UTF-8 message as part of a
    Cease NOTIFICATION message to inform the peer why the BGP session is
    being shutdown or reset. Thanks to Job Snijders ( @job ) for his
    support. 
  + tee plugin, pre_tag_map: introduced support for inspetion of specific
    flow primitives and selective replication over them. The primitives
    supported are: input and output interfaces, source and destination
    MAC addresses, VLAN ID. The feature is now limited to sFlow v5 only. 
    Thanks to Nick Hilliard and Barry O'Donovan for their support.
  + Added src_host_pocode and dst_host_pocode primitives, pocode being a
    compact and (de-)aggregatable (easy to identify districts, cities,
    metro areas, etc.) geographical representation, based on the Maxmind
    v2 City Database. Thanks to Jerred Horsman for his support.
  + Kafka support: introduced support for user-defined (librdkafka) config
    file via the new *_kafka_config_file config directives. Full pathname
    to a file containing directives to configure librdkafka is expected.
    All knobs whose values are string, integer, boolean are supported.
  + AMQP, Kafka plugins: introduced new directives kafka_avro_schema_topic,
    amqp_avro_schema_routing_key to transmit Apache Avro schemas at regular
    time intervals. The routing key/topic can overlap with the one used to
    send actual data.
  + AMQP, Kafka plugins: introduced support for start/stop markers when
    encoding is set to Avro (ie. 'kafka_output: avro'); also Avro schema
    is now embedded in a JSON envelope when sending it via a topic/routing
    key (ie. kafka_avro_schema_topic).
  + print plugin: introduced new config directive avro_schema_output_file
    to save the Apache Avro schema in a separate file (it was only possible
    to have it combined at the beginning of the data file).  
  + BGP daemon: introduced a new bgp_daemon_as config directive to set a
    LocalAS which could be different from the remote peer one. This is to
    establish an eBGP session instead of a iBGP one (default).
  + flow_to_rd_map: introduced support for mpls_vpn_id. In NetFlow/IPFIX
    this is compared against Field Types #234 and #235.
  + sfacctd: introduced support for sFlow v2/v4 counter samples (generic,
    ethernet, vlan). This is in addition to existing support for sFlow v5
    counters.
  + BGP, BMP and Streming Telemetry daemons: added writer_id field when
    writing to Kafka and/or RabbitMQ. The field reports the configured
    core_proc_name and the actual PID of the writer process (so, while
    being able to correlate writes to the same daemon, it's also possible
    to distinguish among overlapping writes).
  + amqp, kafka, print plugins: harmonized JSON output to the above: added
    event_type field, writer_id field with plugin name and PID.
  + BGP, BMP daemons: added AFI, SAFI information to log and dump outputs;
    also show VPN Label if SAFI is MPLS VPN.
  + pmbgpd, pmbmpd: added logics to bypass building RIBs if only logging
    BGP/BMP data real-time.
  + BMP daemon: added BMP peer TCP port to log and dump outputs (for NAT
    traversal scenarios). Contextually, multiple TCP sessions per IP are
    now supported for the same reason.
  + SQL plugins: ported (from print, etc. plugins) the 1.6.1 re-working of
    the max_writers feature.
  + uacctd: use current time when we don't have a timestamp from netlink.
    We only get a timestamp when there is a timestamp in the skb. Notably,
    locally generated packets don't get a timestamp. The patch is courtesy
    by Vincent Bernat ( @vincentbernat ).
  + build system: added configure options for partial linking of binaries
    with any selection/combination of IPv4/IPv6 accounting daemons, BGP
    daemon, BMP daemon and Streaming Telemetry daemon possible. By default
    all are compiled in.
  + BMP daemon: internal code changes to pass additional info from BMP
    per-peer header to bgp_parse_update_msg(). Goal is to expose further
    info, ie. pre- vs post- policy, when logging or dumping BMP info.
  ! fix, BGP daemon: introduced parsing of IPv6 MPLS VPN (vpnv6) NLRIs.
    Thanks to Alberto Santos ( @m4ccbr ) for reporting the issue.
  ! fix, BGP daemon: upon doing routes lookup, now correctly honouring
    the case of BGP-LU (SAFI_MPLS_LABEL). 
  ! fix, BGP daemon: send BGP NOTIFICATION out in case of known failures
    in bgp_parse_msg().
  ! fix, kafka_partition, *_kafka_partition: default value changed from 0
    (partition zero) to -1 (RD_KAFKA_PARTITION_UA, partition unassigned).
    Thanks to Johan van den Dorpe ( @johanek ) for his support.
  ! fix, pre_tag_map: removed constraint for 'ip' keyword for nfacctd and
    sfacctd maps. While this is equivalent syntax to specifying rules with
    'ip=0.0.0.0/0', it allows for map indexing (maps_index: true).
  ! fix, bgp_agent_map: improved sanity check against bgp_ip for IPv6
    addresses (ie. an issue appeared for the case of '::1' where the first
    64 bits are zeroed out). Thanks to Charlie Smurthwaite ( @catphish )
    for reporting the issue.
  ! fix, maps_index: indexing now correctly works for IPv6 pre_tag_map
    entries. That is, those where 'ip', the IP address of the NetFlow/
    IPFIX/sFlow exporter, is an IPv6 address.
  ! fix, pre_tag_map: if mpls_vpn_rd matching condition is specified and
    maps_index is enabled, PT_map_index_fdata_mpls_vpn_rd_handler() now
    picks the right (and expected) info.
  ! fix, pkt_handlers.c: improved definition and condition to free() in
    bgp_ext_handler() in order to prevent SEGVs. Thanks to Paul Mabey for
    his support.
  ! fix, kafka_common.c: removed waiting time from p_kafka_set_topic().
    Added docs advicing to create in advance Kafka topics.
  ! fix, sfacctd, sfprobe: tag and tag2 are now correctly re-defined as
    64 bits long.
  ! fix, sfprobe plugin, sfacctd: tags and class primitives are now being
    encoded/decoded using enterprise #43874, legit, instead of #8800, that
    was squatted back in the times. See issue #71 on GiHub for more info.
  ! fix, sfacctd: lengthCheck() + skipBytes() were producing an incorrect
    jump in case of unknown flow samples. Replaced by skipBytesAndCheck().
    Thanks to Elisa Jasinska ( @fooelisa ) for her support.
  ! fix, pretag_handlers.c: in bgp_agent_map added case for 'vlan and ...'
    filter values.
  ! fix, BGP daemon: multiple issues of partial visibility of the stored
    RIBs and SEGVs when bgp_table_per_peer_buckets was not left default:
    don't mess with bms->table_per_peer_buckets given the multi-threaded
    scenario. Thanks to Dan Berger ( @dfberger ) for his support.
  ! fix, BGP, BMP daemons: bgp_process_withdraw() function init aligned to
    bgp_process_update() in order to prevent SEGVs. Thanks to Yuri Lachin
    for his support.
  ! fix, bgp_msg.c: Route Distinguisher was stored and printed incorrectly
    when of type RD_TYPE_IP. Thanks to Alberto Santos ( @m4ccbr ) for
    reporting the issue.
  ! fix, bgp_logdump.c: p_kafka_set_topic() was being wrongly applied to
    an amqp_host structure (instead of a kafka_host structure). Thanks to
    Corentin Neau ( @weyfonk ) for reporting the issue.
  ! fix, BGP daemon: improved BGP next-hop setting and comparison in cases
    of MP_REACH_NLRI and MPLS VPNs. Many thanks to both Catalin Petrescu
    ( @cpmarvin ) and Alberto Santos ( @m4ccbr ) for their support.
  ! fix, pmbgpd, pmbmpd: pidfile was not written even if configured. Thanks
    to Aaron Glenn ( @aaglenn ) for reporting the issue.
  ! fix, tee plugin: tee_max_receiver_pools is now correctly honoured and
    debug message shows the replicatd protocol, ie. NetFlow/IPFIX vs sFlow.
  ! AMQP, Kafka plugins: separate JSON objects, newline separated, are
    preferred to JSON arrays when buffering of output is enabled (ie.
    kafka_multi_values) and output is set to JSON. This is due to quicker
    serialisation performance shown by the Jansson library.
  ! build system: switched to enable IPv6 support by default (while the
    --disable-ipv6 knob can be used to reverse the behaviour). Patch is
    courtesy by Elisa Jasinska ( @fooelisa ).
  ! build system: given visibility, ie. via -V CL option, into compile
    options enabled by default (ie. IPv6, threads, 64bit counters, etc.).
  ! fix, nfprobe: free expired records when exporting to an unavailable
    collector in order to prevent a memory leak. Patch is courtersy by
    Vladimir Kunschikov ( @kunschikov ).
  ! fix, AMQP plugin: set content type to binary in case of Apache Avro
    output.
  ! fix, AMQP, Kafka plugins: optimized amqp_avro_schema_routing_key and
    kafka_avro_schema_topic. Avro schema is built only once at startup.
  ! fix, cfg.c: improved parsing of config key-values where squared brakets
    appear in the value part. Thanks to Brad Hein ( @regulatre ) for
    reporting the issue. Also, detection of duplicates among plugin and
    core process names was improved. 
  ! fix, misc: compiler warnings: fix up missing includes and prototypes;
    the patch is courtesy by Tim LaBerge ( @tlaberge ).
  ! kafka_consumer.py, amqp_receiver.py: Kafka, RabbitMQ consumer example
    scripts have been greatly expanded to support posting to a REST API or
    to a new Kafka topic, including some stats. Also conversion of multiple
    newline-separated JSON objects to a JSON array has been added. Misc
    bugs were fixed.

1.6.1 -- 31-10-2016
  + Introduced pmbgpd daemon: a stand-alone BGP collector daemon; acts as a
    passive neighbor and maintains per-peer RIBs; can log real-time and/or
    dump at regular time-intervals BGP data to configured backends.
  + Introduced pmbmpd daemon: a stand-alone BMP collector daemon; can log
    real-time and/or dump at regular time-intervals BMP and BGP data to
    configured backends.
  + Introduced Apache Avro as part of print, AMQP and Kafka output: Apache
    Avro is a data serialization system providing rich data structures, a
    compact, fast, binary data format, a container file to store persistent
    data, remote procedure call (RPC) and simple integration with dynamic
    languages. The implementation is courtesy by Codethink Ltd.
  + as_path, std_comm and ext_comm primitives: along with their src counter
    parts, ie. src_as_path etc., have been re-worked to a variagle-length
    internal representation which will lead, when using BGP primitives, to
    memory savings of up to 50% compared to previous releases. 
  + std_comm, ext_comm primitives: primitives are de-coupled so that they
    are not multiplexed anymore in the same field, on output. Added a
    tmp_comms_same_field config directive for backward compatibility.
  + nfacctd: added support for repeated NetFlow v9/IPFIX field types. Also
    flowStartDeltaMicroseconds (IE #158) and flowEndDeltaMicroseconds (#159)
    are now supported for timestamping. 
  + kafka plugin: it is now possible to specify -1 (RD_KAFKA_RTITION_UA) as
    part of the kafka_partition config directive. Also, introduced support
    for Kafka partition keys via kafka_partition_key and equivalent config
    directives.
  + kafka plugin: kafka_broker_host directive now allows to specify multiple
    brokers, ie. "broker1:10000,broker2". The feature relies on capabilities
    of underlying rd_kafka_brokers_add().
  + tee, nfprobe, sfprobe plugins: introduced Kafka support for internal
    pipe and buffering, ie. plugin_pipe_kafka. This is in addition to the
    existing support for homegrown internal buffering and RabbitMQ.
  + tee plugin: introduced support for variable-length buffers which reduces
    CPU utilization.
  + print, MongoDB, AMQP and Kafka plugins: re-worked max_writers feature to
    not rely anymore on waitpid() inside signal handlers as it was failing on
    some OS versions (and could not be reproduced on others). Thanks to
    Janet Sullivan for her support.
  + bgp_follow_nexthop_external: introduced feature to return, when true, the
    next-hop from the routing table of the last node part of the supplied IP
    prefix(es) as value for the 'peer_ip_dst' primitive. When false, default,
    it returns the IP address of the last node part of the bgp_follow_nexthop 
    config key.
  + pmtelemetryd: added initial support for GPB. Input GPB data is currently
    base64'd in the telemetry_data field of the daemon output JSON object. 
  + pmtelemetryd: Added telemetry statistics. For each peer, track the number
    of packets received, how many bytes are pulled off the wire, and the
    resulting message payload. Dump these counts in logdump. Patch is courtesy
    by Tim LaBerge.
  + amqp_markers, kafka_markers: added start/end markers feature to AMQP and
    Kafka plugins output same as for the print plugin (print_markers).
  + pre_tag_map: 'direction' keyword now applies to sFlow too: it does expect
    values 0 (ingress direction) or 1 (egress direction), just like before.
    In sFlow v2/v4/v5 this returns a positive match if: 1) source_id equals
    to input interface and this 'direction' key is set to '0' or 2) source_id
    equals to output interface and this 'direction' key is set to '1'.
  + bgp_agent_map: introduced support for input and output interfaces. This
    is relevant to VPN scenarios.
  + tmp_asa_bi_flow hack: bi-flows use two counters to report counters, ie.
    bytes and packets, in forward and reverse directions. This hack (ab)uses
    the packets field in order to store the extra bytes counter.
  ! fix, nfacctd: debugging NetFlow v9/IPFIX templates, added original field
    type number to the output when the field is known and its description is
    presented.
  ! fix, Jansson: added JSON_PRESERVE_ORDER flag to json_dumps() to give
    output consistency across runs.
  ! fix, kafka_common.c: added rd_kafka_message_destroy() to p_kafka_consume_
    _data() to prevent memory leaks. Thanks to Paul Mabey for his support
    solving the issue.
  ! fix, kafka_common.c: p_kafka_set_topic() now gives it some time for the
    topic to get (auto) created, if needed.
  ! fix, print plugin: improved check for when to print table title (csv,
    formatted). Either 1) print_output_file_append is set to false or 2)
    print_output_file_append is set to true and file is to be created.
  ! fix, print_markers: start marker is now printed also in the case where
    print_output_file_append is set to true. Also, markers are now printed as
    a JSON object, if output is set to JSON.
  ! fix, pkt_handlers.c: removed l3_proto checks from NF_peer_dst_ip_handler()
    for cases where a v6 flows has a v4 BGP next-hop (ie. vpnv6)
  ! fix, pre_tag_map: removed 32 chars length limit from set_label statement.
  ! fix, custom primitives: names are now interpreted as case-insensitive.
    Patch is courtesy by Corentin Neau.
  ! fix, BGP, BMP and Streaming Telemetry: if reopening [bgp, bmp, telemetry]_
    daemon_msglog_file via SIGHUP, reset reload flag.
  ! fix, BGP, BMP and Streaming Telemetry: removed gettimeofday() from bgp_
    peer_dump_init() and bgp_peer_dump_close() in order to maintain a single
    timestamp for a full dump event. Thanks to Tim LaBerge for his support.
  ! fix, BGP, BMP and Streaming Telemetry: output log and dump messages went
    through a general review to improve information consistency and usability.
    Message formats are now documented in docs/MSGLOG_DUMP_FORMATS so to more
    easily track future changes. 
  ! fix, pmtelemetryd: avoiding un-necessary spawn of a default plugin if none
    is defined.
  ! fix, pmtelemetryd: Mask SIGCHLD during socket IO. If we happen to be
    blocked in recv() while a log dump happens, recv() will fail with EINTR.
    This is to mask SIGCHLD during socket IO and restores the original mask
    after the IO completes. Patch is courtesy by Tim LaBerge.
  ! fix, build system: misc improvements made to the build system introduced
    in 1.6.0. Thanks to Vincent Bernat for his support in this area.
  ! fix, compiler warnings: ongoing effort to suppress warning messages when
    compiling. Thanks to Tim LaBerge, Matin Mitchell for their contributions.

1.6.0 -- 07-06-2016
  + Streaming telemetry daemon: quoting Cisco IOS-XR Telemetry Configuration
    Guide at the time of this writing: "Streaming telemetry [ .. ] data
    can be used for analysis and troubleshooting purposes to maintain the
    health of the network. This is achieved by leveraging the capabilities of
    machine-to-machine communication. [ .. ]" Streming telemetry support comes
    in two flavours: 1) a telemetry thread can be started in existing daemons,
    ie. sFlow, NetFlow/IPFIX, etc. for the purpose of data correlation and 2)
    a new daemon pmtelemetryd for standalone consumpton of data. Streaming
    network telemetry data can be logged real-time and/or dumped at regular
    time intervals to flat-files, RabbitMQ or Kafka brokers.
  + BMP daemon: introduced support for Route Monitoring messages. RM messages
    "provide an initial dump of all routes received from a peer as well as an
    ongoing mechanism that sends the incremental routes advertised and
    withdrawn by a peer to the monitoring station". Like for BMP events, RM
    messages can be logged real-time and/or dumped at regular time intervals
    to flat-files, RabbiMQ and Kafka brokers. RM messages are also saved in a
    RIB structure for IP prefix lookup.
  + uacctd: ULOG support switched to NFLOG, the newer and L3 independent Linux
    packet logging framework. One of the key advantages of NFLOG is support for
    IPv4 and IPv6 (whereas ULOG was restricted to IPv4 only). The code has been
    contributed by Vincent Bernat ( @vincentbernat ). 
  + build system: it was modernized so not to rely on specific and old versions
    of automake and autoconf, as it was the case until 1.5. Among the things,
    pkg-config and libtool are leveraged and an autogen.sh script is generated.
    The code has been contributed by Vincent Bernat ( @vincentbernat ).
  + sfacctd: RabbitMQ and Kafka support was introduced to real-time log and/
    or dump at regular time intervals of sFlow counters. This is in addition
    to existing support for flat-files.
  + maps_index: several improvements were carried out in the area of indexing
    of maps: optimizations to pretag_index_fill() and pretag_index_lookup() to
    improve lookup speeds; optimized id_entry structure, ie. by splitting key
    and non-key parts, and hashing key in order to consume less memory; added
    duplicate entry detection (cause of sudden index destruction);
    pretag_index_destroy() destroys hash keys for each index entry, solving a
    memory leak issue. Thanks to Job Snijders ( @job ) for his support.
  + Introduced 'export_proto_seqno' aggregation primitive to report on
    sequence number of the export protocol (ie. NetFlow, sFlow, IPFIX). This
    feature may enable more advanced offline analysis of packet loss, out of
    orders, etc. over time windows than basic online analytics provided by the
    daemons. 
  + log.c: logging moved from standard output (stdout) to standard error
    (stderr) so to not conflict with stdout printing of statistics (print
    plugin). Thanks to Jim Westfall ( @jwestfall69 ) for his support. 
  + print plugin: introduced a new print_output_lock_file config directive 
    to lock standard output (stdout) output so to prevent multiple processes
    (instances of the same print plugin or different instances of print plugin)
    overlap output. Thanks to Jim Westfall ( @jwestfall69 ) for his support. 
  + pkt_handlers.c: euristics in NetFlow v9/IPFIX VLAN handler were improved
    for the case of flows in egress direction. Also IP protocol checks were
    removed for UDP/TCP ports and TCP flags in case the export protocol is
    NetFlow v9/IPFIX. Thanks to Alexander Ponamarchuk for his support.
  ! Code refactoring: improved re-usability of much of the BGP code (so to
    make it possible to use it as a library for some BMP daemon features, ie.
    Route Monitoring messages support); consolidated functions to handle log
    and print plugin output files; improved log messages to always include
    process name and type.
  ! fix, bpf_filter.c: issue compiling against libpcap 1.7.x; introduced a
    check for existing bpf_filter() in libpcap in order to prevent namespace
    conflicts.
  ! fix, tmp_net_own_field default value changed to true. This knob can be
    still switched to false for this release but is going to be removed soon.
  ! fix, cfg.c, cfg_handlers.c, pmacct.c: some configuration directives and
    pmacct CL parameters requiring string parsing, ie. -T -O -c, are now
    passed through tolower().
  ! fix, MongoDB plugin: removed version check around mongo_create_index()
    and now defaulting to latest MongoDB C legacy driver API. This is due to
    some versioning issue in the driver.
  ! fix, timestamp_arrival: primitive was reporting incorrect results (ie.
    always zero) if timestamp_start or timestamp_end were not also specified
    as part of the same aggregation method. Many thanks to Vincent Morel for
    reporting the issue.
  ! fix, thread stack: a value of 0, default, leaves the stack size to the
    system default or pmacct minimum (8192000) if system default is too low.
    Some systems may throw an error if the defined size is not a multiple of
    the system page size.
  ! fix, nfacctd: improved NetFlow v9/IPFIX parsing. Added new length checks
    and fixed some existing checks. Thanks to Robert Wuttke ( @Benocs ) for his
    support.
  ! fix, pretag_handlers.c: BPAS_map_bgp_nexthop_handler() and BPAS_map_bgp_
    peer_dst_as_handler() were not setting a func_type.
  ! fix, JSON support: Jansson 2.2 does not have json_object_update_missing()
    function which was introduced in 2.3. This is not provided as part of a
    jansson.c file and compiled in conditionally, if needed. Jansson 2.2 is
    still shipped along by some recent OS releases. Thanks to Vincent Bernat
    ( @vincentbernat ) for contributing the patch.
  ! fix, log.c: use a format string when calling syslog(). Passing directly a
    potentially uncontrolled string could crash the program if the string
    contains formatting parameters. Thanks to Vincent Bernat ( @vincentbernat )
    for contributing the patch.
  ! fix, sfacctd.c: default value for config.sfacctd_counter_max_nodes was set
    after sf_cnt_link_misc_structs(). Thanks to Robin Douine for his support
    resolving the issue.
  ! fix, sfacctd.c: timestamp was consistently being reported as null in sFlow
    counters output. Thanks to Robin Douine for his support resolving the issue.
  ! fix, SQL plugins: $SQL_HISTORY_BASETIME environment variable was reporting a
    wrong value (next basetime) in the sql_trigger_exec script. Thanks to Rain
    Nõmm for reporting the issue.
  ! fix, pretag.c: in pretag_index_fill(), replaced memcpy() with hash_dup_key()
    also a missing res_fdata initialization in pretag_index_lookup() was solved;
    these issues were originating false negatives upon lookup. Thanks to Rain
    Nõmm fo his suppor.
  ! fix, ISIS daemon: hash_* functions renamed into isis_hash_* to avoid name
    space clashes with their BGP daemon counter-parts.
  ! fix, kafka_common.c: rd_kafka_conf_set_log_cb moved to p_kafka_init_host()
    due to crashes seen in p_kafka_connect_to_produce(). Thanks to Paul Mabey
    for his support resolving the issue.
  ! fix, bgp_lookup.c: bgp_node_match_* were not returning any match in
    bgp_follow_nexthop_lookup(). Thanks to Tim Jackson ( @jackson-tim ) for his
    support resolving the issue.
  ! fix, sql_common.c: crashes observed when nfacctd_stitching was set to true
    and nfacctd_time_new was set to false. Thanks to Jaroslav Jiráse
    ( @jjirasek ) for his support solving the issue.
  - SQL plugins: sql_recovery_logfile feature was removed from the code due
    to lack of support and interest. Along with it, also pmmyplay and pmpgplay
    tools have been removed. 
  - pre_tag_map: removed support for mpls_pw_id due to lack of interest.

1.5.3 -- 14-01-2016
  + Introduced the Kafka plugin: Apache Kafka is publish-subscribe messaging
    rethought as a distributed commit log. Its qualities being: fast, scalable,
    durable and distributed by design. pmacct Kafka plugin is designed to
    send aggregated network traffic data, in JSON format, through a Kafka
    broker to 3rd party applications.
  + Introduced Kafka support to BGP and BMP daemons, in both their msglog
    and dump flavors (ie. see [bgp|bmp]_daemon_msglog_kafka_broker_host and
    [bgp_table|bmp]_dump_kafka_broker_host and companion config directives).
  + Introduced support for a Kafka broker to be used for queueing and data
    exchange between Core Process and plugins. plugin_pipe_kafka directive,
    along with all other plugin_pipe_kafka_* directives, can be set globally
    or apply on a per plugin basis - similarly to what was done for RabbitMQ
    (ie. plugin_pipe_amqp). Support is currently restricted only to print
    plugin.
  + Added a new timestamp_arrival primitive to expose NetFlow/IPFIX records
    observation time (ie. arrival at the collector), in addition to flows
    start and end times (timestamp_start and timestamp_end respectively).
  + plugin_pipe_amqp: feature extended to the plugins missing it: nfprobe,
    sfprobe and tee.
  + Introduced bgp_table_dump_latest_file: defines the full pathname to
    pointer(s) to latest file(s). Update of the latest pointer is done
    evaluating files modification time. Many thanks to Juan Camilo Cardona
    ( @jccardonar ) for proposing the feature.
  + Introduced pmacctd_nonroot config directive to allow to run pmacctd
    from a user with non root privileges. This can be desirable on systems
    supporting a tool like setcap, ie. 'setcap "cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=ep"
    /path/to/pmacctd', to assign specific system capabilities to unprivileged
    users. Patch is courtesy by Laurent Oudot ( @loudot-tehtris ).
  + Introduced plugin_pipe_check_core_pid: when enabled (default), validates
    the sender of data at the plugin side. Useful when plugin_pipe_amqp or
    plugin_pipe_kafka are enabled and hence a broker sits between the daemon
    Core Process and the Plugins.
  + A new debug_internal_msg config directive to specifically enable debug
    of internal messaging between Core process and plugins.
  ! bgp_table_dump_refresh_time, bmp_dump_refresh_time: max allowed value
    raised to 86400 from 3600.
  ! [n|s]facctd_as_new renamed [n|s]facctd_as; improved input checks to all
    *_as (ie. nfacctd_as) and *_net (ie. nfacctd_net) config directives.
  ! pkt_handlers.c: NF_sampling_rate_handler(), SF_sampling_rate_handler()
    now perform a renormalization check at last (instead of at first) so to
    report the case of unknown (0) sampling rate.
  ! plugin_pipe_amqp_routing_key: default value changed to '$core_proc_name-
    $plugin_name-$plugin_type'. Also, increased flexibility for customizing
    the key with the use of variables (values computed at startup).
  ! Improved amqp_receiver.py example with CL arguments and better exception
    handling. Also removed file amqp_receiver_trace.py, example is now merged
    in amqp_receiver.py.
  ! fix, BGP daemon: several code optimizations and a few starving conditions
    fixed. Thanks to Markus Weber ( @FvDxxx ) for his peer index round-robin
    patch; thanks also to Job Snijders ( @job ) for his extensive support in
    this area.
  ! fix, BMP daemon: greatly improved message parsing and segment reassembly;
    RabbitMQ broker support found broken; several code optimizations are also
    included.
  ! fix, bgp_table.c: bgp_table_top(), added input check to prevent crashes
    in cases table contains no routes.
  ! fix, networks_file: missing atoi() for networks_cache_entries. Patch is
    courtesy by Markus Weber ( @FvDxxx ).
  ! fix, plugin_pipe_amqp_routing_key: check introduced to prevent multiple
    plugins to bind to the same RabbitMQ exchange, routing key combination.
    Thanks to Jerred Horsman for reporting the issue.
  ! fix, MongoDB plugin: added a custom oid fuzz generator to prevent
    concurrent inserts to fail; switched from deprecated mongo_connect() to
    mongo_client(); added MONGO_CONTINUE_ON_ERROR flag to mongo_insert_batch
    along with more verbose error reporting. Patches are all courtesy by
    Russell Heilling ( @xchewtoyx ).
  ! fix, nl.c: increments made too early after introduction of MAX_GTP_TRIALS
    Affected: pmacctd processing of GTP in releases 1.5.x. Patch is courtesy
    by TANAKA Masayuki ( @tanakamasayuki ).
  ! fix, pkt_handlers.c: improved case for no SAMPLER_ID, ALU & IPFIX in
    NF_sampling_rate_handler() on par with NF_counters_renormalize_handler().
  ! fix, SQL scripts: always use "DROP TABLE IF EXISTS" for both PostgreSQL
    and SQLite. Pathes are courtesy by Vincent Bernat ( @vincentbernat ).
  ! fix, plugin_hooks.c: if p_amqp_publish_binary() calls were done while a
    sleeper thread was launched, a memory corruption was observed.
  ! fix, util.c: mkdir() calls in mkdir_multilevel() now default to mode 777
    instead of 700; this allows more play with files_umask (by default 077).
    Thanks to Ruben Laban for reporting the issue.
  ! fix, BMP daemon: solved a build issue under MacOS X. Path is courtesy by
    Junpei YOSHINO ( @junpei-yoshino ).
  ! fix, util.c: self-defined Malloc() can allocate more than 4GB of memory;
    function is also now renamed pm_malloc().
  ! fix, PostgreSQL plugin: upon purge, call sql_query() only if status of
    the entry is SQL_CACHE_COMMITTED. Thanks to Harry Foster ( @harryfoster )
    for his support resolving the issue.
  ! fix, building system: link pfring before pcap to prevend failures when
    linking. Patch is courtesy by @matthewsf . 
  ! fix, plugin_common.c: memory leak discovered when pending queries queue
    was involved (ie. cases where print_refresh_time > print_history). Thanks
    to Edward Henigin for reporting the issue.

1.5.2 -- 07-09-2015
  + Introduced support for a RabbitMQ broker to be used for queueing and
    data exchange between Core Process and plugins. This is in alternative to
    the home-grown circular queue implementation. plugin_pipe_amqp directive,
    along with all other plugin_pipe_amqp_* directives, can be set globally
    or apply on a per plugin basis (ie. it is a valid scenario, if multiple
    plugins are instantiated, that some make use of home-grown queueing,
    while others use RabbitMQ based queueing).
  + Introducting support for Maximind GeoIP v2 (libmaxminddb) library: if
    pmacct is compiled with --enable-geoipv2, this defines full pathname to
    a Maxmind GeoIP database v2 (libmaxminddb) Only the binary database
    format is supported (ie. it is not possible to load distinct CSVs for
    IPv4 and IPv6 addresses).
  + Introduced infrastructure for sFlow counters and support specifically for
    generic, ethernet and vlan counters. Counters are exported in JSON format
    to files, specified via sfacctd_counter_file. The supplied filename can
    contain as variable the sFlow agent IP address.
  + Introduced a new thread_stack config directive to allow to modify the
    thread stack size. Natanael Copa reported that some libc implementations,
    ie. musl libc, may set a stack size that is too small by default.
  + Introduced networks_file_no_lpm feature: it applies when aggregation
    method includes src_net and/or dst_net and nfacctd_net (or equivalents)
    and/or nfacctd_as_new (or equivalents) are set to longest (or fallback):
    an IP prefix defined as part of the supplied networks_file wins always,
    even if it's not longest.
  + tee plugin: added support for (non-)transparent IPv6 replication [further
    QA required]
  + plugin_common.c, sql_common.c: added log message to estimate base cache
    memory usage.
  + print, AMQP, MongoDB plugins; sfacctd, BGP, BMP daemons: introducing
    timestamps_since_epoch to write timestamps in 'since Epoch' format.
  + nfacctd: flow bytes counter can now be sourced via element ID #352
    (layer2OctetDeltaCount) in addition to element ID's already supported.
    Thanks to Jonathan Thorpe for his support.
  + Introducing proc_priority: redefines the process scheduling priority,
    equivalent to using the 'nice' tool. Each daemon process, ie. core,
    plugins, etc., can define a different priority.
  ! fix, BMP daemon: improved preliminar checks in bmp_log_msg() and added
    missing SIGHUP signal handling to reload bmp_daemon_msglog_file files.
  ! fix, bgp_logdump.c: under certain configuration conditions call to both
    write_and_free_json() and write_and_free_json_amqp() was leading to SEGV.
    Thanks to Yuriy Lachin for reporting the issue.
  ! fix, BGP daemon: improved BGP dump output: more accurate timestamping of
    dump_init, dump_close events. dump_close now mentions amount of entries
    and tables dumped. Thanks to Yuriy Lachin for brainstorming around this.
  ! fix, cfg.c: raised amount of allowed config lines from 256 to 8K.
  ! fix, print/AMQP/MongoDB plugins: SEGV observed when IPFIX vlen variables 
    were stored in the pending_queries_queue structure (ie. as a result of a
    time mismatch among the IPFIX exporter and the collector box).
  ! fix, vlen primitives: when 'raw' semantics was selected, print_hex() was
    returning wrong hex string length (one char short). As a consequence
    occasionally some extra dirty chars were seen at the end of the converted
    string.
  ! fix, vlen primitives: memory leak verified in print/AMQP/MongoDB plugins.
  ! fix, print, MongoDB & AMQP plugins: dirty values printed as part of the
    'proto' under certain conditions. Thanks to Rene Stoutjesdijk for his
    support resolving the issue.
  ! fix, amqp_common.c: amqp_exchange_declare() call changed so to address
    the change of rabbitmq-c API for support of auto_delete & internal for
    exchange.declare. Backward compatibility with rabbitmq-c <= 0.5.2 is
    also taken care of. Thanks to Brent Van Dussen for reporting the issue.
  ! fix, compiling on recent FreeBSD: solved some errors catched by the -Wall
    compiler flag. Thanks to Stephen Fulton for reporting the issue. Most of
    the patch is courtesy by Mike Bowie.
  ! fix, print/AMQP/MongoDB plugins: enforcing cleanup of malloc()ed structs
    part of entries added to the pending queue, ie. because seen as future
    entries due to a mismatch of the collector clock with the one of NetFlow/
    IPFIX exporter(s). This may have lead to data inconsistencies.
  ! fix, amqp_common.c: Content type was only specified for messages published
    when the amqp_persistent_msg configuration option is specified. This info
    should always be applied to describe the payload of the message. Patch is
    courtesy by Will Dowling.
  ! fix, amqp_plugin.c: generate an error on compile if --enable-rabbitmq is
    specified without --enable-jansson. It's clear in the documentation that
    both are required for AMQP support, but if built without jansson it will
    silently not publish messages to AMQP. Patch is courtesy by Will Dowling.
  ! fix, amqp_common.c: modified the content type to "application/json" in
    line with RFC4627. Patch is courtesy by Will Dowling.
  ! fix, setsockopt(): u_int64_t pipe_size vars changed to int, in line with
    typical OS buffer limits (Linux, Solaris). Introduced check supplied pipe
    size values are not bigger than INT_MAX. Many thanks to Markus Weber for
    reporting the issue.
  ! fix, nl.c: removed pretag_free_label() from pcap_cb() and ensuring init
    of pptrs. Under certain conditions SEGVs could be noticed.
  ! fix, flow stitching: when print/AMQP/MongoDB plugins were making use of
    the pending queries queue, ie. to compensate for time offsets/flows in
    the future, the stitching feature could potentially lead to SEGV due to
    unsettled pointers.
  ! fix, pgsql plugin: SEGV were noticed when insert/update queries to the
    PostgreSQL database were returning different than PGRES_COMMAND_OK, hence
    triggering the reprocess mechanism. Thanks very much to Alan Turower for
    his support.
  ! fix, improved logging of elements received/sent at buffering point between
    core process and plugins. Also added explicit start/end purge log message
    for cases in which there is no data to purge. 
  ! fix, signals.c: ignore_falling_child() now logs if a child process exited
    with abnormal conditions; this is useful to track writer processes (created
    by plugins) are terminated by a signal, ie. SEGV. This is already the case
    for plugins themselves, with the Core Process reporting a simlar log
    message in case of abnormal exit. Thanks very much to Rene Stoutjesdijk
    for his support.
  ! fix, preprocess-data.h: added supported functions minf, minb, minbpp and
    minppf to non SQL plugins. Thanks to Jared Deyo for reporting the issue. 
  ! fix, nfprobe_plugin.c: IP protocol was not set up correctly for IPv6
    traffic in NetFlow v9/IPFIX. Thanks to Gabriel Vermeulen his support
    solving the issue.

1.5.1 -- 21-02-2015
  + BMP daemon: BMP, BGP Monitoring Protocol, can be used to monitor BGP
    sessions. The current implementation is base on the draft-ietf-grow-bmp-07
    IETF draft. The daemon currently supports BMP events and stats only, ie.
    initiation, termination, peer up, peer down and stats reports messages.
    Route Monitoring is future (upcoming) work but routes can be currently
    sourced via the BGP daemon thread (best path only or ADD-PATH), making
    the two daemons complementary. The daemon enables to write BMP messages
    to files or AMQP queues, real-time (msglog) or at regular time intervals
    (dump) and is a separate thread in the NetFlow (nfacctd) or sFlow (sfacctd)
    collectors.
  + tmp_net_own_field directive is introduced to record both individual source
    and destination IP addresses and their IP prefix (nets) as part of the same
    aggregation method. While this should become default behaviour, a knob for
    backward-compatibility is made available for all 1.5 until the next major
    release.
  + Introduced nfacctd_stitching and equivalents (ie. sfacctd_stitching):
    when set to true, given an aggregation method, two new non-key fields are
    added to the aggregate upon purging data to the backend: timestamp_min is
    the timestamp of the first element contributing to a certain aggregate
    and timestamp_max is the timestamp of the last element. In case the export
    protocol provides time references, ie. NetFlow/IPFIX, these are used; if not
    the current time (hence time of arrival to the collector) is used instead.
  + Introduced amqp_routing_key_rr feature to perform round-robin load-
    balancing over a set of routing keys. This is in addition to existing,
    and more involved, functionality of tag-based load-balancing.
  + Introduced amqp_multi_values feature: this is same feature in concept as
    sql_multi_values (see docs). The value is the amount of elements to pack
    in each JSON array. 
  + Introduced amqp_vhost and companion (ie. bgp_daemon_msglog_amqp_vhost)
    configuration directives to define the AMQP/RabbitMQ server virtual host.
  + BGP daemon: bgp_daemon_id now allows to define the BGP Router-ID disjoint
    from the bgp_daemon_ip definition. Thanks to Bela Toros for his patch. 
  + tee plugin: introduced tee_ipprec feature to color replicated packets,
    both in transparent and non-transparent modes. Useful, especially when
    in transparent mode and replicating to hosts in different subnets, to
    verify which packets are coming from the replicator.
  + tee plugin: plugin-kernel send buffer size is now configurable via a new
    config directive tee_pipe_size. Improved logging of send() failures.
  + nfacctd: introduced support for IPFIX sampling/renormalization using
    element IDs: #302 (selectorId), #305 (samplingPacketInterval) and #306
    (samplingPacketSpace). Many thanks to Rene Stoutjesdijk for his support.
  + nfacctd: added also support for VLAN ID for NetFlow v9/IPFIX via element
    type #243 (it was already supported via elements #58 and #59). Support was
    also added for 802.1p/CoS via element #244.
  + nfacctd: added native support for NetFlow v9/IPFIX IE #252 and #253 as
    part of existing primitives in_iface and out_iface (additional check).
  + pre_tag_map: introduced 'cvlan primitive. In NetFlow v9 and IPFIX this is
    compared against IE #245. The primitive also supports map indexing.
  + Introduced pre_tag_label_filter to filter on the 'label' primitive in a
    similar way how the existing pre_tag_filter feature works against the
    'tag' primitive. Null label values (ie. unlabelled data) can be matched
    using the 'null' keyword. Negations are allowed by pre-pending a minus
    sign to the label value.
  + IMT plugin: introduced '-i' command-line option to pmacct client tool: it
    shows last time (in seconds) statistis were cleared via 'pmacct -e'.
  + print, MongoDB & AMQP plugins: sql_startup_delay feature ported to these
    plugins.
  ! sql_num_hosts: the feature has been improved to support IPv6 addresses.
    Pre-requisite is definition of INET6_ATON() function in the RDBMS, which
    is the case for MySQL >= 5.6.3. In SQLite such function has to be defined
    manually.
  ! nfacctd: improved NF_evaluate_flow_type() euristics to reckon NetFlow/
    IPFIX event (NAT, Firewall, etc.) vs traffic (flows) records.
  ! fix, GeoIP: spit log notification (warning) in case GeoIP_open() returns
    null pointer.
  ! fix, IMT plugin: pmacct client -M and -N queries were failing to report
    results on exact matches. Affected: 1.5.0. Thanks to Xavier Vitard for
    reporting the issue. 
  ! fix, pkt_handlers.c: missing else in NF_src_host_handler() was causing
    IPv6 prefix being copied instead of IPv6 address against NetFlow v9 recs
    containing both info.
  ! fix, uacctd: informational log message now shows the correct group the
    daemon is bound to. Thanks to Marco Marzetti for reporting the issue.
  ! fix, nfv9_template.c: missing byte conversion while decoding templates
    was causing SEGV under certain conditions. Thanks to Sergio Bellini for
    reporting the issue.

1.5.0 -- 28-08-2014
  + Introduced bgp_daemon_msglog_file config directive to enable streamed
    logging of BGP messages/events. Each log entry features a time reference,
    BGP peer IP address, event type and a sequence number (to order events
    when time reference is not granular enough). BGP UPDATE messages also
    contain full prefix and BGP attributes information. Example given in
    QUICKSTART file, chapter XIIf.
  + Introduced dump of BGP tables at regular time intervals. The filename,
    which can include variables, is set by bgp_table_dump_file directive.
    The output format, currently only JSON, can be set in future via the
    bgp_table_dump_output directive. The time interval between dumps can
    be set via the bgp_table_dump_refresh_time directive. Example given in
    QUICKSTART file, chapter XIIf.
  + Introduced support for internally variable-length primitives (likely
    candidates are strings). Introduced also the 'label' primitive which
    is a variable-length string equivalent of tag and tag2 primitives. Its
    value are set via a 'set_label' statement in a pre_tag_map (see examples/
    pretag.map.example). If, ie. as a result of JEQ's in a pre_tag_map,
    multiple 'set_label' are applied, then default operation is append
    labels and separate by a comma.
  + pmacct project has been assigned PEN #43874. nfprobe plugin: tag, tag2,
    label primitives are now encoded in IPFIX making use of the pmacct PEN.
  + Ported preprocess feature to print, MongoDB and AMQP plugins. Preprocess
    allows to process aggregates (via a comma-separated list of conditionals
    and checks) while purging data to the backend thus resulting in a
    powerful selection tier. minp, minb, minf, minbpp, minppf checks have
    been currently ported. As a result of the porting a new set of config
    directives are added, ie. print_preprocess and print_preprocess_type.
  + print, MongoDB & AMQP plugins: if data (start/base) time is greater than
    commit time then place in pending queue and after purging event re-insert
    in cache. Concept ported from SQL plugins.
  + MySQL, PostgreSQL plugins: sql_locking_style now supports keyword "none"
    to disable locking. This method can help in certain cases, for example
    when grants over the whole database (requirement for "table" locking in
    MySQL) is not available.
  + util.c: open_logfile() now calls mkdir_multilevel() to allow building
    intermediate directory levels, if not existing. This brings all log
    files in line with capabilities of print_output_file directive.
  + Introduced [u|pm]acctd_flow_tcp_lifetime to defines how long a TCP flow
    could remain inactive. This is in addition to [u|pm]acctd_flow_lifetime
    that allows to define the same for generic, ie. non-TCP, flows. Thanks to
    Stathis Gkotsis for his support.
  + Introducing nfacctd_account_options: if set to true account for NetFlow/
    IPFIX option records as well as flow ones. pre_tag_map offers sample_type
    value of 'option' now to split option data records from flow ones.
  + nfprobe plugin: support for custom-defined primitives has been introduced
    in line with other plugins. With such feature it will be possible to
    augment NetFlow v9/IPFIX records with custom fields (in IPFIX also PENs
    are supported).
  + Built a minimal API, for internal use only, around AMQP. Goal is to make
    re-use of the same AMQP structures for different purposes (logging, BGP
    daemon dumps, AMQP plugin, etc.).
  ! fix, BGP daemon: introduced bgp_peer_info_delete() to delete/free BGP
    info after a BGP peer disconnects.
  ! fix, print, AMQP, memory plguins: when selecting JSON output, jansson
    library json_decref() is used in place of free() to free up memory
    allocated by JSON objects. Using free() was originating memory leaks.
  ! fix, AMQP plugin: in line with other plugins QN (query number or in case
    of AMQP messagess number) in log messages now reflects the real number of
    messages sent to the RabbitMQ message exchange and not just all messages
    in the queue. Thanks to Gabriel Snook for reporting the issue.
  ! fix, IMT plugin: memory leak due to missed calls to free_extra_allocs()
    in case all extras.off_* were null. Thanks to Tim Jackson for his support
    resolving the issue.
  ! fix, pmacctd: if reading from a pcap_savefile, introduce a short usleep()
    after each buffer worth of data so to give time plugins to process/cache
    it.
  ! fix, SQL plugins: SQL handler types now include primitives registry index
  ! fix, print, AMQP & MongoDB plugins: added free() for empty_pcust allocs
  ! fix, plugin hooks: improved checks to prevent the last buffer on a pipe
    to plugins (plugin_pipe_size) could go partly out of bounds.
  ! fix, nfacctd: improved handling of IPFIX vlen records.
  ! fix, nfprobe: SEGV if custom primitives are defined but array structure
    is not allocated.
  ! fix, nfprobe: wrong length was calculated in IPv6 templates for fields
    with PEN != 0.
  ! fix, plugin_common.c: declared struct pkt_data in P_cache_insert_pending
    to be pointed by prim_ptrs. primptrs_set_all_from_chained_cache() is now
    safe if prim_ptrs is null.
  ! fix, nfprobe: tackled the case of coexisting 1) PEN and non-PEN custom   
    primitives and 2) variable and fixed custom primitives.
  ! fix, plugin_common.c: declared struct pkt_data in P_cache_insert_pending
    to be pointed by prim_ptrs. primptrs_set_all_from_chained_cache() is now
    safe if prim_ptrs is null. 
  ! fix, lofging: selected configuration file is now logged. cfg_file is passed
    through realpath() in order to always log the absolute path.
  ! fix, print, MongoDB & AMQP plugins: pm_setproctitle() invoked upon forking
    writer processes in alignment with SQL plugins.
  ! fix, pmacct client: it's now possible to query and wildcard on primitives
    internally allocated over what_to_count_2 registry.

1.5.0rc3 -- 18-04-2014
  + BGP daemon: support for BGP ADD-PATH capability draft-ietf-idr-add-paths
    has been introduced, useful to advertise known paths when BGP multi-path
    is enabled in a network. The correct BGP info is linked to traffic data
    using BGP next-hop (or IP next-hop if use_ip_next_hop is set to true) as
    selector among the paths available.
  + pre_tag_map: de-globalized the feature so that, while Pre-Tagging is
    evaluated in the Core Process, each plugin can be defined a own/local
    pre_tag_map.
  + maps_row_len: directive introduced to define the maximum length of map
    (ie. pre_tag_map) rows. The default value is suitable for most scenarios,
    though tuning it could be required either to save on memory or to allow
    for longer entries (ie. filters).
  + Introduced use_ip_next_hop config directive: when IP prefix aggregation
    (ie. nfacctd_net) is set to 'netflow', 'sflow' or 'fallback' populate
    'peer_dst_ip' field from NetFlow/sFlow IP next hop field if BGP next-hop
    is not available.
  + AMQP plugin: implemented persistent messaging via amqp_persistent_msg
    configuration directive so to protect against RabbitMQ restarts. Feature
    is courtesy by Nick Douma.
  + pmacct in-memory plugin client: -T option now supports how many entries
    to show via '<bytes | packets | flows>,[<# how many>]' argument syntax.
  + nfprobe plugin: take BGP next-hop from a defined networks_file. This is
    in addition to existing feature to take BGP next-hop from a BGP feed.
  + Set of *_proc_name configuration directives renamed to core_proc_name.
    Value of core_proc_name is now applied to logging functions and process
    title.
  + Re-implemented reverse BGP lookup based primitives, src_as_path src_med
    src_std_comm src_ext_comm and src_local_pref, in print, MongoDB and
    AMQP plugins. Primitives have also been re-documented.
  + pre_tag_map: set_tag and set_tag2 can now be auto-increasing values, ie.
    "set_tag=1++": "1" being the selected floor value at startup and "++"
    instructs to increase the tag value at every pre_tag_map iteration. Many
    thanks to Brent Van Dussen and Gabriel Snook for their support.
  + Added support for NetFlow v9/IPFIX source/destination IPv4/IPv6 prefixes
    encoded as flow types: #44, #45, #169 and #170.
  + [sql|print|mongo|amqp]_history and sql_trigger_time can now be specified
    also in seconds, ie. as '300' or '300s' alternatively to '5m'. This is to
    ease syncronization of these values against refresh time to the backend,
    ie. sql_refresh_time.
  + Added post_tag2 configuration directive to set tag2 similarly to what
    post_tag does.
  + SQL plugins: agent_id, agent_id2 fields renamed to tag, tag2. Issued SQL
    table schema #9 for agent_id backward compatibility. Renaming agent_id2
    to tag2 is going to be disruptive to existing deployments instead.
    UPGRADE doc updated. 
  + print, MongoDB, AMQP plugins: added [print|mongo|amqp]_max_writers set of
    configuration directives to port from SQL plugins the idea of max number
    of concurrent writer processes the plugin is allowed to start.
  + util.c: comments can now start with a '#' symbol in addition to existing
    '!'.
  ! fix, BGP daemon: removed a non-contextual BGP message length check. Same
    check is already done in the part handling payload reassembly.
  ! fix, BGP daemon: MP_REACH_NLRI not assumed to be anymore at the end of a
    route announcement. 
  ! fix, MySQL plugin: added linking of pmacct code against -lstdc++ and
    -lrt if MySQL plugin is enabled, pre-requisite for MySQL 5.6. Many
    thanks to Stefano Birmani for reporting the issue.
  ! fix, sql_common.c: memory leak affecting AS-PATH and BGP communities.
    Version 1.5.0rc2 affected. Thanks to Brent Van Dussen for his support
    solving the issue.
  ! fix, MongoDB plugin: timestamp_start, timestamp_end moved from timestamp
    type, reserved for internal use, to date.
  ! fix, print, memory, MongoDB, AMQP plugins: if no AS_PATH information is
    available an empty string, ie. "", is placed as value (instead of former
    "^$"). Similar stream-lining was done for communities. Many thanks to
    Brent Van Dussen and Elisa Jasinska for reporting the issue.
  ! fix, AMQP, MongoDB plugins: increased default refresh time to 60 secs,
    up from 10 and in line with SQL plugins value.
  ! fix, nfprobe plugin: IPv6 source/destination masks passed as IE #29 and
    #30 and not anymore as their IPv4 counterparts.
  ! fix, pmacct.c: clibuf variable now malloc'd at runtime so to not impact
    the data segment.
  ! fix, log.c: removed sbrk() calls when logging to Syslog.
  ! fix, pmacctd: If compiling against PF_RING, check and compile against
    libnuma and librt which are new requirement since version 5.6.2. Thanks
    to Joan Juvanteny for reporting the issue.
  ! fix, net_aggr.c: 'prev' array to keep track of hierarchies of networks
    was being re-initialized by some compilers. Thanks to Joan Juvanteny for
    reporting the issue.
  ! fix, MongoDB, JSON outputs: dst_host_country primitive was not properly
    shown. Patch is courtesy by Stig Thormodsrud.
  ! fix, pre_tag_map: a memory leak was found when reloading rules containing
    'filter' keywords. Thanks to Matt Jenkins for his support resolving the
    issue.
  ! fix, server.c: countered a timing issue to ensure EOF is sent after data.
    Issue was originated by conjunction of non-blocking socket and multiple
    CPU cores. Thanks to Juan Camilo Cardona and Joel Ouellette Jr for their
    support.
  ! fix, acct.c: added length check to hash_crc32() of custom primitives as
    selective pmacct IMT client queries, ie. -M and -N, were failing to match
    entries. Thanks to Joel Ouellette Jr for his support.
  ! fix, nfacctd: NetFlow v9/IPFIX sampling correlation has been improved by
    placing system scoped sampling options in a separate table. Such table is
    queried if no matching sampler ID is found for a given <exporter IP addr,
    source ID>. Sampling-related fields (ie. sampler ID, interval, etc.) are
    now all supported if 1, 2 or 4 bytes long.
  ! fix, nfacctd: improved handling of the NAT64 case for NSEL. Thanks to 
    Gregoire Leroy for his support.
  ! fix, nfacctd, sfacctd and BGP daemon: if IPv6 is enabled, IPv4 mapped is
    supported and can't obtain an IPv6 socket to listen to, retry with a IPv4
    one.

1.5.0rc2 -- 25-12-2013
  + nfacctd: introduced support for variable-length IPFIX fields for custom-
    defined aggregation primitives: 'string' semantics is supported and
    maximum expected length of the field should be specified as 'len'
    primitive definition. Also PENs are now supported: field_type can be
    <value> or <PEN>:<value>. Finally, 'raw' semantics to print raw data,
    fixed or variable length in hex format was added.
  + pmacctd, uacctd: introducing custom-defined aggregation primitives in 
    libpcap and ULOG daemons. A new 'packet_ptr' keyword is supported in the
    aggregate_primitives map for the task: it defines the base pointer in the
    packet where to read the primitive value; intuitively, this is to be used
    in conjunction with 'len'. The supported syntax is: <layer>:[<protocol
    value>]+[<offset>]. 'layer' keys  are: 'packet', 'mac', 'vlan', 'mpls',
   'l3', 'l4', 'payload'. Examples are provided in 'examples/primitives.lst'.
  + nfacctd: introduced pro rating algorithm if sql_history is enabled and
    nfacctd_time_new is disabled. Although ideal, the feature is disabled
    by default for now and can be enabled by setting nfacctd_pro_rating to
    true. Given a NetFlow/IPFIX flow duration greater than time-bins size as
    configured by sql_history, bytes/packets counters are proportionally
    distributed across all time-bins spanned by the flow. Many thanks to
    Stefano Birmani for his support. 
  + Introducing index_maps: enables indexing of maps to increase lookup speeds
    on large maps and/or sustained lookup rates. Indexes are automatically
    defined basing on structure and content of the map, up to a maximum of 8.
    Indexing of pre_tag_map, bgp_peer_src_as_map, flows_to_rd_map is supported.
  + BGP daemon: introduced bgp_daemon_interval and bgp_daemon_batch config
    directives: to prevent massive syncronization of BGP peers to contend
    resources, BGP sessions are accepted in batches: these define the time
    interval between any two batches and the amount of BGP peers in each batch
    respectively.
  + Introducing historical accounting offset (ie. sql_history_offset) to set
    an offset to timeslots basetime. If history is set to 30 mins (by default
    creating 10:00, 10:30, 11:00, etc. time-bins), with an offset of, say,
    900 seconds (so 15 mins) it will create 10:15, 10:45, 11:15, etc. time-
    bins.
  + print, MongoDB, SQL plugins: improved placement of tuples in the correct
    table when historical accounting (ie. sql_history) and dynamic table
    names (ie. sql_table) features are both in use.
  + print, MongoDB, SQL plugins: dynamic file names (print plugin) and
    tables (MongoDB and SQL plugins) can now include $peer_src_ip, $tag and
    $tag2 variables: value is populated using the processed record value for
    peer_src_ip, tag, tag2 primitives respectively.
  + print plugin: introduced print_latest_file to point latest filename for
    print_output_file time-series. Until 1.5.0rc1 selection was automagic.
    But having introduced variable spool directory structures and primitives-
    related variables the existing basic scheme of producing pointers had to
    be phased-out.
  + IMT plugin: added EOF in the client-server communication so to detect
    uncompleted messages and print an error message. Thanks to Adam Jacob
    Muller for his proposal.
  + Introduced [nf|sf|pm]acctd_pipe size and bgp_daemon_pipe_size config
    directives to define the size of the kernel socket used read traffic data
    and for BGP messaging respectively.
  + pmacctd, uacctd: mpls_top_label, mpls_bottom_label and mpls_stack_depth
    primitives have been implemented.
  + pmacctd, uacctd: GTP tunnel handler now supports inspection of GTPv1.
  + pre_tag_map: results of evaluation of pre_tag_map, in case of a positive
    match, overrides any tags passed by nfprobe/sfprobe plugins via NetFlow/
    sFlow export.  
  + pre_tag_map: stack keyword now supports logical or operator (A | B) in
    addition to sum (A + B).
  + pre_tag_map: introduced 'mpls_pw_id' keyword to match the signalled MPLS
    L2 VPNs Pseudowire ID. In NetFlow v9/IPFIX this is compared against IE
    #249; in sFlow v5 this is compared against vll_vc_id field, extended MPLS
    VC object.
  + Introduced log notifications facility: allows to note down specific log
    notifications have been sent so to prevent excessive repetitive output.
  ! fix, plugin_hooks.c: plugin_buffer_size variables are bumped to u_int64_t
  ! fix, plugin_hooks.c: improved protection of internal pmacct buffering
    (plugin_buffer_size, plugin_pipe_size) from inconsistencies: buffer is now
    also invalidated by the core process upon first writing into it. Thanks to
    Chris Wilson for his support.
  ! fix, plugin_hooks.c: a simple default value for plugin_pipe_size and
    plugin_buffer_size is now picked if none is supplied. This is to get
    around tricky estimates. 1.5.0rc1 release affected.
  ! fix, ll.c: ntohl() done against a char pointer instead of u_int32_t one
    in MPLS handler was causing incorrect parsing of labels. Thanks to Marco
    Marzetti for his support.
  ! fix, net_aggr.c: IPv6 networks debug messages now report correctly net
    and mask information. Also IPv6 prefix to peer source/destination ASN was
    crashing due to an incorrect pointer. Finally applying masks to IPv6
    addresses was not done correctly. Thanks to Brent Van Dussen for
    reporting the issue.
  ! fix, classifiers: slightly optimized search_class_id_status_table() and
    added warning message if the amount of classifiers exceeds configured
    number of classifier_table_num (by default 256).
  ! fix, pre_tag_map: if a JEQ can be resolved into multiple labels, stop to
    the first occurrence.
  ! fix, nfacctd, sfacctd: IPv6 was not being correctly reported due to a
    re-definition of NF9_FTYPE_IPV6. 1.5.0rc1 release affected. Thanks to
    Andrew Boey for reporting the issue.
  ! fix, nfacctd: when historical accounting is enabled, ie. sql_history, not
    assume anymore start and end timestamps to be of the same kind (ie. field
    type #150/#151, #152/#153, etc.).
  ! fix, BGP daemon: default BGP RouterID used if supplied bgp_daemon_ip is
    "0.0.0.0" or "::"
  ! fix, BGP daemon: the socket opened to accept BGP peerings is restricted
    to che core process (ie. closed upon instantiating the plugins). Thanks
    to Olivier Benghozi for reporting the issue.
  ! fix, BGP daemon: memory leak detected accepting vpnv4 and vpnv6 routes.
    Thanks to Olivier Benghozi for his support solving the issue.
  ! fix, BGP daemon: compiling the package without IPv6 support and sending
    ipv6 AF was resulting in a buffer overrun. Thanks to Joel Krauska for his
    support resolving the issue.
  ! fix, IMT plugin: when gracefully exiting, ie. via a SIGINT signal, delete
    the pipe file in place for communicating with the pmacct IMT client tool.
  ! fix, print, MongoDB, AMQP plugins: saved_basetime variable initialized
    to basetime value. This prevents P_eval_historical_acct() to consume much
    resources during the first time-bin, if historical accounting is enabled
   (ie. print_history). 1.5.0rc1 release affected.
  ! fix, print, MongoDB and SQL plugins: purge function is escaped if there
    are no elements on the queue to process. 
  ! fix, AMQP plugin: removed amqp_set_socket() call so to be able to compile
    against rabbitmq-c >= 0.4.1
  ! fix, MongoDB plugin: change of API between C driver version 0.8 and 0.7
    affected mongo_create_index(). MongoDB C driver version test introduced.
    Thanks to Maarten Bollen for reporting the issue.
  ! fix, print plugin: SEGV was received if no print_output_file is specified
    ie. print to standard output.
  ! fix, MongoDB: optimized usage of BSON objects array structure.
  ! fix, MongoDB plugin: brought a few numerical fields, ie. VLAN IDs, CoS,
    ToS, etc. to integer representation, ie. bson_append_int(), from string
    one, ie. bson_append_string(). Thanks to Job Snijders for his support.
  ! fix, MySQL plugin: improved catching condition of sql_multi_value set too
    little value. Thanks to Chris Wilson for reporting the issue.
  ! fix, nfprobe plugin: catch ENETUNREACH errors instead of bailing out.
    Patch is courtesy by Mike Jager.

1.5.0rc1 -- 29-08-2013
  + Introducing custom-defined aggregation primitives: primitives are defined
    via a file pointed by aggregate_primitives config directive. The feature
    applies to NetFlow v9/IPFIX fields only, and with a pre-defined length.
    Semantics supported are: 'u_int' (unsigned integer, presented as decimal
    number), 'hex' (unsigned integer, presented as hexa- decimal number), 'ip'
    (IP address), 'mac' (MAC address)and 'str' (string). Syntax along with
    examples are available in the 'examples/primitives.lst' file.
  + Introducing JSON output in addition to tabular and CSV formats. Suitable
    for injection in 3rd party tools, JSON has the advantage of being a self-
    consisting format (ie. compared to CSV does not require a table title).
    Library leveraged is Jansson, available at: http://www.digip.org/jansson/
  + Introducing RabbitMQ/AMQP pmacct plugin to publish network traffic data
    to message exchanges. Unicast, broadcast, load-balancing scenarios being
    supported. amqp_routing_key supports dynamic elements, like the value of
    peer_src_ip and tag primitives or configured post_tag value, enabling
    selective delivery of data to consumers. Messages are encoded in JSON
    format.
  + pre_tag_map (and other maps): 'ip' key, which is compared against the IP
    address originating NetFlow/IPFIX or the AgentId field in sFlow, can now
    be an IP prefix, ie. XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX/NN, so to apply tag statements to
    set of exporters or 0.0.0.0/0 to apply to any exporter. Many thanks to
    Stefano Birmani for his support.
  + Re-introducing support for Cisco ASA NSEL export. Previously it was just
    a hack. Now most of the proper work done for Cisco NEL is being reused:
    post_nat_src_host (field type #40001), post_nat_dst_host (field type
    #40002), post_nat_src_port (field type #40003), post_nat_dst_port (field
    type #40004), fw_event (variant of nat_event, field type #40005) and
    timestamp_start (observation time in msecs, field type #323).
  + Introducing MPLS-related aggregation primitives decoded from NetFlow v9/
    IPFIX, mpls_label_top mpls_label_bottom and mpls_stack_depth, so to give
    visibility in export scenarios on egress towards core, MPLS interfaces.
  + mpls_vpn_rd: primitive value can now be sourced from NetFlow v9/IPFIX
    field types #234 (ingressVRFID) and #235 (egressVRFID). This is in
    addition to existing method to source value from a flow_to_rd_map file.
  + networks_file: AS field can now be defined as "<peer_as>_<origin_as>",
    Useful also to define (or override) elments of an internal port-to-port
    traffic matrix.
  + print plugin: creation of intermediate directory levels is now supported;
    directories can contain dynamic time-based elements hence the amount of
    variables in a given pathname was also lifted to 32 from 8.
  + print plugin: introduced print_history configuration directive, which
    supports same syntax as, for example, sql_history. When enabled, time-
    related variables substitution of dynamic print_output_file names are
    determined using this value instead of print_refresh_time one.
  + Introducing IP prefix labels, ie. for custom grouping of own IP address
    space. The feature can be enabled by a --enable-plabel when configuring
    the package for compiling. Labels can be defined via a networks_file.
  + mongo_user and mongo_passwd configuration directive have been added in
    order to support authentication with MongoDB. If both are omitted, for
    backward compatibility, authentication is disabled; if only one of the
    two is specified instead, the other is set to its default value.
  + Introducing mongo_indexes_file config directive to define indexes in
    collections with dynamic name. If the collection does not exist yet, it
    is created. Index names are picked by MongoDB.
  + print plugin: introduced print_output_file_append config directive: if
    set to true allows the plugin to append to an output file rather than
    overwrite.
  + bgp_agent_map: added bgp_port key to lookup a NetFlow agent also against
    a BGP session port (in addition to BGP session IP address/router ID): it
    aims to support scenarios where BGP sessions do NAT traverals.
  + peer_dst_ip (BGP next-hop) can now be inferred by MPLS_TOP_LABEL_ADDR
    (NetFlow v9/IPFIX field type #47). This field might replace BGP next-hop
    when NetFlow is exported egress on MPLS-enabled core interfaces.
  + Introducing [nf|pm|sf|u]acctd_proc_name config directives to define the
    name of the core process (by default always set to 'default'). This is
    the equivalent to instantiate named plugins but for the core process.
    Thanks to Brian Rak for bringing this up.
  + pre_tag_map: introduced key 'flowset_id' to tag NetFlow v9/IFPIX data
    records basing on their flowset ID value, part of the flowset header.
  + pmacct client: introduced '-V' command-line option to verify version,
    build info and compile options passed to the configure script; also a
    new -a option now allows to retrieve supported aggregation primitives
    and their description.
  + Check for mallopt() has been added at configure time. mallopt() calls
    are introduced in order to disable glibc malloc() boundary checks.
  ! flow_to_rd_map replaces iface_to_rd_map, increasing its scope: it is
    now possible to map <MPLS bottom label, BGP next-hop> couples to BGP/
    MPLS VPN Route Distinguishers (RD). This is in addition to existing
    mapping method basing on <ingress router, input interface>.
  ! fix, nfacctd, sfacctd: Setsocksize() call effectiveness is now verified
    via a subsequent getsockopt(). If result is different than expected, an
    informational log message is issued.
  ! fix, building system: removed stale check for FreeBSD4 and introduced
    check for BSD systems. If on a BSD system, -DBSD is now passed over to
    the compiler.
  ! fix, tee plugin: transparent mode now works on FreeBSD systems. Patch
    is courtesy by Nikita V. Shirokov.
  ! fix, peer_dst_ip: uninitialized pointer variable was causing unexpected
    behaviours. Thanks to Maarten Bollen for his support resolving this.
  ! fix, IMT plugin: selective queries with -M and -N switches verified not
    working properly. Thanks to Acipia organization for providing a patch.
  ! fix, sql_common.c: src_port and dst_port primitives correctly spelled if
    used in conjunction with BGP primitives. Thanks to Brent Van Dussen and
    Elisa Jasinska for flagging the issue.
  ! fix, building system: added library checks in /usr/lib64 for OS's where
    it is not linked to /lib where required. 
  ! fix, print, MongoDB and AMQP plugins: P_test_zero_elem() obsoleted.
    Instead, the cache structure 'valid' field is used to commit entries to
    the backend.
  ! fix, nfacctd: in NetFlow v9/IPFIX, if no time reference is specified as
    part of records, fall back to time reference in datagram header.
  ! fix, MongoDB plugin: mongo_insert_batch() now bails out with MONGO_FAIL
    if something went wrong while processing elements in the batch and an
    error message is issued. Typical reason for such condition is batch is
    too big for the resources, mainly memory, available. Thanks very much to
    Maarten Bollen for his support.
  ! fix, cfg_handlers.c: all functions parsing configuration directives, and
    expecting string arguments, are now calling lower_string() so to act as
    case insensitive.
  ! fix, IPv6 & NetFlow exporter IP address: upon enabling IPv6, NetFlow
    exporter IP addresses were written as IPv4-mapped IPv6 address. This was
    causing confusion when composing maps since the 'ip' field would change
    depending on whether IPv6 was enabled or not. This is now fixed and IPv4-
    mapped IPv6 addresses are now internally translated to plain IPv4 ones.
  ! fix, nfacctd: NetFlow v9/IPFIX source/destination peer ASN information
    elements have been found mixed up and are now in proper order. 

0.14.3 -- 03-05-2013
  + tee plugin: a new tee_receivers configuration directive allows multiple
    receivers to be defined. Receivers can be optionally grouped, for example
    for load-balancing (rr, hash) purposes, and attached a list of filters
    (via tagging). The list is fully reloadable at runtime.
  + A new pkt_len_distrib aggregation primitive is introduced: it works by
    defining length distribution bins, ie. "0-999,1000-1499,1500-9000" via
    the new pkt_len_distrib_bins configuration directive. Maximum amount
    of bins that can be defined is 255; lengths must be within the range
    0-9000.
  + Introduced NAT primitives to support Cisco NetFlow Event Logging (NEL),
    for Carrier Grade NAT (CGNAT) scenarios: nat_event, post_nat_src_host,
    post_nat_dst_host, post_nat_src_port and post_nat_dst_port. Thanks to
    Simon Lockhart for his input and support developing the feature.
  + Introduced timestamp primitives (to msec resolution) to support generic
    logging functions: timestamp_start, timestamp_end (timestamp_end being
    currently applicable only to traffic flows). These primitives must not
    be confused with existing sql_history timestamps which are meant for the
    opposite function instead, temporal aggregation.
  + networks_file: introduced support for (BGP) next-hop (peer_dst_ip) in
    addition to existing fields. Improved debug output. Also introduced a
    new networks_file_filter feature to make networks_file work as a filter
    in addition to its resolver functionality: if set to true net and host
    values not belonging to defined networks are zeroed out. See UPGRADE
    document for backward compatibility.
  + BGP daemon: added support for IPv6 NLRI and IPv6 BGP next-hop elements
    for rfc4364 BGP/MPLS Virtual Private Networks.
  + MongoDB plugin: introduced mongo_insert_batch directive to define the
    amount of elements to be inserted per batch - allowing the plugin to
    scale better. Thanks for the strong support to Michiel Muhlenbaumer and
    Job Snijders.
  + pre_tag_map: 'set_qos' feature introduced: matching network traffic is
    set 'tos' primitive to the specified value. This is useful if collecting
    ingress NetFlow/IPFIX at both trusted and untrusted borders, allowing to
    selectively override ToS values at untrusted ones. For consistency,
    pre_tag_map keys id and id2 have been renamed to set_tag and set_tag2;
    legacy jargon is still supported for backward compatibility.
  + sfacctd: improved support for L2 accounting, ethernet length is being
    committed as packet length; this information gets replaced by any length
    information will come from upper layers, if any is reported. Thanks to
    Daniel Swarbrick for his support.
  + nfacctd: introduced nfacctd_peer_as directive to value peer_src_as and
    peer_dst_as primitives from NetFlow/IPFIX export src_as and dst_as
    values respectively (ie. as a result of a "ip flow-export .. peer-as"
    config on the exporter). The directive can be plugin-specific.
  + print, memory plugins: print_output_separator allows to select separator
    for CSV outputs. Default comma separator is generally fine except for
    BGP AS-SET representation.
  ! Building sub-system: two popular configure switches, --enable-threads
    and --enable-64bit, are now set to true by default.
  ! fix, print & mongodb plugins: added missing cases for src_net and dst_net
    primitives. Thanks to John Hess for his support.
  ! fix, SQL plugins: improved handling of fork() calls when return value
    is -1 (fork failed). Many thanks to Stefano Birmani for his valuable
    support troubleshooting the issue.
  ! fix, ISIS daemon: linked list functions got isis_ prefix in order to
    prevent namespace clashes with other libraries (ie. MySQL) we link
    against. Thanks to Stefano Birmani for reporting the issue.
  ! fix, tee plugin: can't bridge AFs when in transparent mode is not fatal
    error condition anymore to tackle transient interface conditions. Error
    message is throttled to once per 60 secs. Thanks to Evgeniy Kozhuhovskiy
    for his support troubleshooting the issue.
  ! fix, nfacctd: extra length checks introduced when parsing NetFlow v9/
    IPFIX options and data template flowsets. Occasional daemon crashes were
    verified upon receipt of malformed/incomplete template data.
  ! fix: plugins now bail out with an error message if core process is found
    dead via a getppid() check.
  - nfacctd_sql_log feature removed. The same can now be achieved with the
    use of proper timestamp primitives (see above).

0.14.2 -- 14-01-2013
  + pmacct opens to MongoDB, a leading noSQL document-oriented database
    via a new 'mongodb' plugin. Feature parity is maintained with all
    existing plugins. The QUICKSTART doc includes a brief section on how
    to getting started with it. Using MongoDB >= 2.2.0 is  recommended;
    MongoDB C driver is required.
  + GeoIP lookups support has been introduced: geoip_ipv4 and geoip_ipv6
    config directives now allow to load Maxmind IPv4/IPv6 GeoIP database
    files; two new traffic aggregation primitives are added to support the
    feature: src_host_country and dst_host_country. Feature implemented
    against all deamons and all plugins and supports both IPv4 and IPv6.
    Thanks to Vincent Bernat for his patches and precious support.
  + networks_file: user-supplied files to define IP networks and their
    associations to ASNs (optional) has been hooked up to the 'fallback'
    (longest match wins) setting of [pm|u|sf|nf]acctd_net, [pm|u]acctd_as
    and [sf|nf]acctd_as_new. Thanks to John Hess for his support.
  + A new sampling_rate traffic aggregation primitive has been introduced:
    to report on the sampling rate to be applied to renormalize counters
    (ie. useful to support troubleshooting of untrusted node exports and
    hybrid scenarios where a partial sampling_map is supplied). If renorm
    of counters is enabled (ie. [n|s]facctd_renormalize set to true) then
    sampling_rate will show as 1 (ie. already renormalized).
  + sql_table, print_output_file, mongo_table: dynamic table names are
    now enriched by a $ref variable, populated with the configured value
    for refresh time, and a $hst variable, populated with the configured
    value for sql_history (in secs).
  + Solved the limit of 64 traffic aggregation primitives: the original
    64 bits bitmap is now split in a 16 bits index + 48 bits registry
    with multiple entries (currently 2). cfg_set_aggregate() and, in
    future, cfg_get_aggregate() functions are meant to safely manipulate
    the new bitmap structure and detect mistakes in primitives definition.
  ! fix, print plugin: removed print_output_file limitation to 64 chars.
    Now maximum filename length is imposed by underlying OS.
  ! fix, print plugin: primitives are selectively enabled for printing
    based on 'aggregate' directive.
  ! fix, print plugin: pointer to latest file been generated is updated
    at very last in the workflow.
  ! fix, ip_flow.c: incorrect initialization for IPv6 flow buffer. Thanks
    to Mike Jager for reporting the issue and providing a patch.
  ! fix, pre_tag_map: improved matching of pre_tag_map primitives against
    IPFIX fields. Thanks to Nikita V Shirokov for reporting the issue.
  ! fix, nfprobe plugin: improved handling of unsuccessful send() calls
    in order to prevent file descriptors depletion and log failure cause.
    Patch is courtesy by Mike Jager.
  ! fix, nfacctd: gracefully handling the case of NetFlow v9/IPFIX flowset
    length of zero; unproper handling of the condition was causing nfacctd
    to infinite loop over the packet; patch is courtesy by Mike Jager.
  ! fix, Setsocksize(): setsockopt() replaces Setsocksize() in certain
    cases and Setsocksize() fix to len parameter. Patch is courtesy by
    Vincent Bernat

0.14.1 -- 03-08-2012
  + nfacctd: introduced support for IPFIX variable-length IEs (RFC5101),
    improved support for IPFIX PEN IEs. 
  + nfacctd, sfacctd: positive/negative caching for bgp_agent_map and
    sampling_map is being introduced. Cache entries are invalidated upon 
    reload of the maps.
  + bgp_agent_map: resolution of IPv4 NetFlow agents to BGP speakers
    with IPv6 sessions is now possible. This is to support dual-stack
    network deployments. Also the keyword 'filter' is introduced and
    supported values are only 'ip' and 'ip6'.
  + nfacctd: etype primitive can be populated from IP_PROTOCOL_VERSION,
    ie. Field Type #60, in addition to ETHERTYPE, ie. Field Type #256.
    Should both be present the latter has priority over the former.
  + print plugin: introduced a pointer to the latest filename in the set,
    ie. in cases when variable filenames are specified. The pointer comes
    in the shape of a symlink called "<plugin name>-latest". 
  ! fix, pretag_handlers.c: BGP next-hop handlers are now hooked to the
    longest-match mechanism for destination IP prefix.
  ! fix, net_aggr.c: defining a networks_file configuration directive in
    conjunction with --enable-ipv6 was causing a SEGVs. This is now solved.
  ! fix, uacctd: cache routine is now being called in order to resolve
    in/out interface ifindexes. Patch is courtesy by Stig Thormodsrud.
  ! fix, BGP daemon: bgp_neighbors_file now lists also IPv6 BGP peerings.
  ! fix, sql_common.c: SQL writers due to safe action are now logged with
    a warning message rather than debug.
  ! fix, PostgreSQL table schemas: under certain conditions, default
    definition of stamp_inserted was generating a 'date/time field value
    out of range: "0000-01-01 00:00:00"' error. Many thanks to Marcello
    di Leonardo for reporting the issue and providing a fix.
  ! fix, IS-IS daemon: sockunion_print() function was found not portable
    and has been removed.
  ! fix, BGP daemon: memcpy() replaced by ip6_addr_cpy() upon writing to
    sockaddr_in6 structures. 
  ! fix, EXAMPLES document has been renamed QUICKSTART for disambiguation
    on filesystems where case-sensitive names are not supported.
  ! Several code cleanups. Patches are courtesy by Osama Abu Elsorour
    and Ryan Steinmetz.

0.14.0 -- 11-04-2012
  + pmacct now integrates an IS-IS daemon within collectors; the daemon
    is being run as a parallel thread within the collector core process;
    a single L2 P2P neighborship, ie. over a GRE tunnel, is supported;
    it implements P2P Hello, CSNP and PSNP - and does not send any LSP
    information out. The daemon is currently used for route resolution.
    It is well suited to several case-studies, popular one being: more
    specific internal routes are carried within the IGP while they are
    summarized in BGP crossing cluster boundaries.
  + A new aggregation primitive 'etype' has been introduced in order to
    support accounting against the EtherType field of Ethernet frames.
    The implementation is consistent across all data collection methods
    and backends.
  + sfacctd: introduced support for samples generated on ACL matches in
    Brocade (sFlow sample type: Enterprise: #1991, Format: #1). Thanks
    to Elisa Jasinska and Brent Van Dussen for their support.
  + sfacctd, pre_tag_map: introduced sample_type key. In sFlow v2/v4/v5
    this is compared against the sample type field. Value is expected
    in <Enterprise>:<Format> notation.
  ! fix, signals.c: ignoring SIGINT and SIGTERM in my_sigint_handler()
    to prevent multiple calls to fill_pipe_buffer(), condition that can
    cause pipe buffer overruns. Patch is courtesy by Osama Abu Elsorour.
  ! fix, pmacctd: tunnel registry now correctly supports multiple tunnel
    definitions for the same stack level. 
  ! fix, print plugin: cos field now correctly shows up in the format
    title while CSV format is selected and L2 primitives are enabled.
  ! fix, util.c: a feof() check has been added to the fread() call in
    read_SQLquery_from_file(); thanks to Elisa Jasinska and Brent Van
    Dussen for their support.
  ! fix, nfprobe: NetFlow output socket is now re-opened after failing
    send() calls. Thanks to Maurizio Molina for reporting the problem.
  ! fix, sfacctd: length checks have been imporved while extracting
    string tokens (ie. AS-PATH and BGP communities) from sFlow Extended
    Gateway object. Thanks to Duncan Small for his support.

0.14.0rc3 -- 07-12-2011
  + BGP daemon: BGP/MPLS VPNs (rfc4364) implemented! This encompasses both
    RIB storage (ie. virtualization layer) and lookup. bgp_iface_to_rd_map
    map correlates <router IP, input/output interfaces (ifIndex)> couples
    to Route Distinguishers (RDs). RD encapsulation types #0 (2-bytes ASN),
    #1 (IP address) and #2 (4-bytes ASN) are supported. Examples provided:
    examples/bgp_iface_to_rd.map and EXAMPLES files.
  + mpls_vpn_rd aggregation primitive has been added to the set. Also this
    is being supported key in Pre-Tagging (pre_tag_map). 
  + print plugin: introduced print_output_file feature to write statistics
    to files. Output is text, formatted or CSV. Filenames can contain time-
    based variables to make them dynamic. If filename is static instead,
    content is overwritten over time.
  + print plugin: introduced print_time_roundoff feature to align time slots
    nicely, same as per the sql_history_roundoff directive.
  + print plugin: introduced print_trigger_exec feature to execute custom
    scripts at each print_refresh_time interval (ie. to process, expire,
    gzip, etc. files). Feature is in sync with wrap-up of data commit to
    screen or files.
  + pmacctd: introduced support for DLT_LOOP link-type (ie. OpenBSD tunnel
    interfaces). Thanks to Neil Reilly for his support. 
  + uacctd: a cache of ifIndex is introduced. Hash structure with conflict
    chains and short expiration time (ie. to avoid getting tricked by cooked
    interfaces devices a-la ppp0). The cache is an effort to gain speed-ups.
    Implementation is courtesy by Stephen Hemminger, Vyatta.
  + Logging: introduced syslog-like timestamping when writing directly to
    files. Also a separate FD per process is used and SIGHUP elicits files
    reopening: all aimed at letting proper logs rotation by external tools.
  + Introduced plugin_pipe_backlog configuration directive: it induces a
    backlog of buffers on the pipe before actually releasing them to the
    plugin. The strategy helps optimizing inter-process communications, ie.
    when plugins are quicker processing data than the Core process.
  ! fix, peer_src_ip primitive: has been disconnected from [ns]facctd_as_new
    mechanism in order to ensure it's always representing a reference to the
    NetFlow or sFlow emitter.
  ! fix, nfprobe: input and output VLAN ID field types have been aligned to
    RFC3954, which appears to be also retroactively supported by IPFIX. The
    new field types are #58 and #59 respectively. Thanks to Maurizio Molina
    for pointing the issue out.
  ! fix, IMT plugin: fragmentation of the class table over multiple packets
    to the pmacct IMT client was failing and has been resolved. 
  ! fix, nfprobe: individual flows start and end timestamps are now filled
    to the msec resolution. Thanks to Daniel Aschwanden for having reported
    the issue.
  ! fix, uacctd: NETLINK_NO_ENOBUFS is set to prevent the daemon being
    reported about ENOBUFS events by the underlying operating system. Works
    on kernels 2.6.30+. Patch is courtesy by Stephen Hemminger, Vyatta.
  ! fix, uacctd: get_ifindex() can now return values greater than 2^15. Patch
    is courtesy by Stephen Hemminger, Vyatta.
  ! fix, pmacctd, uacctd: case of zero IPv6 payload in conjunction with no
    IPv6 next header is now supported. Thanks to Quirin Scheitle for having
    reported the issue.
  - Support for is_symmetric aggregation primitive is discontinued.

0.14.0rc2 -- 26-08-2011
  + sampling_map feature is introduced, allowing definition of static traffic
    sampling mappings. Content of the map is reloadable at runtime. If a
    specific router is not defined in the map, the sampling rate advertised
    by the router itself, if any, is applied.
  + nfacctd: introduced support for 16 bits SAMPLER_IDs in NetFlow v9/IPFIX;
    this appears to be the standard length with IOS-XR.
  + nfacctd: introduced support for (FLOW)_SAMPLING_INTERVAL fields as part
    of the NetFlow v9/IPFIX data record. This case is not prevented by the
    RFC although such information is typically exported as part of options.
    It appears some probes, ie. FlowMon by Invea-Tech, are getting down this
    way.
  + nfacctd, sfacctd: nfacctd_as_new and sfacctd_as_new got a new 'fallback'
    option; when specified, lookup of BGP-related primitives is done against
    BGP first and, if not successful, against the export protocol.
  + nfacctd, sfacctd: nfacctd_net and sfacctd_net got a new 'fallback' option
    that when specified looks up network-related primitives (prefixes, masks)
    against BGP first and, if not successful, against the export protocol. It
    gets useful for resolving prefixes advertised only in the IGP.
  + sql_num_hosts feature is being introduced: defines, in MySQL and SQLite
    plugins, whether IP addresses should be left numerical (in network bytes
    ordering) or converted into strings. For backward compatibility, default
    is to convert them into strings.
  + print_num_protos and sql_num_protos configuration directives have been
    introduced to allow to handle IP protocols (ie. tcp, udp) in numerical
    format. The default, backward compatible, is to look protocol names up.
    The feature is built against all plugins and can also be activated via
    the '-u' commandline switch.
  ! fix, nfacctd: NetFlow v9/IPFIX sampling option parsing now doesn't rely
    anymore solely on finding a SamplerID field; as an alternative, presence
    of a sampling interval field is also checked. Also a workaround is being
    introduced for sampled NetFlow v9 & C7600: if samplerID within a data
    record is defined and set to zero and no match was possible, then the
    last samplerID defined is returned.
  ! nfacctd: (FLOW)_SAMPLING_INTERVAL fields as part of the NetFlow v9/IPFIX
    data record are now supported also 16-bits long (in addition to 32-bits).
  ! fix, SQL plugins: sql_create_table() timestamp has been aligned with SQL
    queries (insert, update, lock); furthermore sql_create_table() is invoked
    every sql_refresh_time instead of every sql_history. Docs updated. Thanks
    to Luis Galan for having reported the issue.
  ! fix, pmacct client: error code when connection is refused on UNIX socket
    was 0; it has been changed to 1 to reflect the error condition. Thanks
    to Mateusz Viste for reporting the issue.
  ! fix, building system: CFLAGS were not always honoured. Patch is courtesy
    of Etienne Champetier
  ! fix, ll.c: empty return value was causing compiler with certain flags to
    complain about the issue. Patch is courtesy of Ryan Steinmetz.

0.14.0rc1 -- 31-03-2011
  + IPFIX (IETF IP Flow Information Export protocol) replication and
    collector capabilities have been introduced as part of nfacctd, the
    NetFlow accounting daemon of the pmacct package. 
  + nfprobe plugin: initial IPFIX export implementation. This is called
    via a 'nfprobe_version: 10' configuration directive. pmacctd, the
    promiscuous mode accounting daemon, and uacctd, the ULOG accounting
    daemon, both part of the pmacct package are now supported.
  + Oracle's BrekeleyDB 11gR2 offers a perfect combination of technologies
    by including an SQL API that is fully compatible with SQLite. As a
    result pmacct now opens to BerkeleyDB 5.x via its SQLite3 plugin.
  + sfacctd: BGP-related traffic primitives (AS Path, local preference,
    communities, etc.) are now read from sFlow Extended Gateway object if
    sfacctd_as_new is set to false (default).
  + nfacctd, sfacctd: source and destination peer ASNs are now read from
    NetFlow or sFlow data if [ns]facctd_as_new is set to false (default). 
  + nfacctd: introduced support for NetFlow v9/IPFIX source and destination
    peer ASN field types 128 and 129. The support is enabled at runtime by
    setting to 'false' (default) the 'nfacctd_as_new' directive. 
  + sfacctd: f_agent now points sFlow Agent ID instead of source IP address;
    among the other things, this allows to compare BGP source IP address/BGP
    Router-ID against the sFlow Agent ID.
  + PostgreSQL plugin: 'sql_delimiter' config directive being introduced:
    if sql_use_copy is true, uses the supplied character as delimiter.Useful
    in cases where the default delimiter is part of any of the supplied
    strings.
  + pmacct client: introduced support for Comma-Separated Values (CSV) output
    in addition to formatted-text. A -O commandline switch allows to enable
    the feature.
  ! fix, MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQLite3 plugins: insert of data into the database
    can get arbitrarily delayed under low traffic conditions. Many Thanks
    to Elisa Jasinska and Brent Van Dussen for their great support in solving
    the issue. 
  ! fix, BGP daemon: multiple BGP capabilities per capability announcement
    were not supported - breaking compliancy with RFC5492. The issue was
    only verified against a OpenBGPd speaker. Patch is courtesy of Manuel
    Guesdon.
  ! fix, initial effort made to document uacctd, the ULOG accounting daemon

0.12.5 -- 28-12-2010
  + nfacctd: introduced support for NAT L3/L4 field values via xlate_src
    and xlate_dst configuration directives. Implementation follows IPFIX
    standard for IPv4 and IPv6 (field types 225, 226, 227, 228, 281 and
    282).
  + nfacctd: Cisco ASA NetFlow v9 NSEL field types 40001, 40002, 40003,
    40004 and IPFIX/Cisco ASA NetFlow v9 NSEL msecs absolute timestamps
    field types 152, 153 and 323 have been added.
  + nfacctd: introduced support for 'new' TCP/UDP source/destination ports
    (field types 180, 181, 182, 183), as per IPFIX standard, basing on the
    L4 protocol value (if any is specified as part of the export; otherwise
    assume L4 is not TCP/UDP). 
  + nfacctd, nfprobe: introduced support for application classification
    via NetFlow v9 field type #95 (application ID) and application name
    table option. This feature aligns with Cisco NBAR-NetFlow v9
    integration feature.
  + nfacctd: introduced support for egress bytes and packet counters (field
    types 23, 24) basing on the direction value (if any is specified as
    part of the export; otherwise assume ingress as per RFC3954).
  + nfprobe: egress IPv4/IPv6 NetFlow v9 templates have been introduced;
    compatibility with Cisco (no use of OUT_BYTES, OUT_OUT_PACKETS) taken
    into account.
  + nfacctd: added support for egress datalink NetFlow v9 fields basing
    on direction field.
  + nfacctd, sfacctd: aggregate_filter can now filter against TCP flags;
    also, [ns]facctd_net directive can now be specified per-plugin.
  + BGP daemon: introduced support for IPv6 transport of BGP messaging.
  + BGP daemon: BGP peer information is now linked into the status table
    for caching purposes. This optimization results in good CPU savings
    in bigger deployments.
  ! fix, nfacctd, sfacctd: daemons were crashing on OpenBSD platform upon
    setting an aggregate_filter configuration directive. Patch is courtesy
    of Manuel Pata.
  ! fix, xflow_status.c: status entries were not properly linked to the
    hash conflict chain resulting in a memory leak. However the maximum
    number of table entries set by default was preventing the structure
    to grow undefinitely.
  ! fix, sql_common.c: increased buffer size available for sql_table_schema
    from 1KB to 8KB. Thanks to Michiel Muhlenbaumer his support. 
  ! fix, bgp_agent_map has been improved to allow mapping of NetFlow/sFlow
    agents making use of IPv6 transport to either a) IPv4 transport address
    of BGP sessions or b) 32-bit BGP Router IDs. Mapping to IPv6 addresses
    is however not (yet) possible.
  ! fix, nfprobe: encoding of NetFlow v9 option scope has been improved;
    nfprobe source IPv4/IPv6 address, if specified via nfprobe_source_ip
    directive, is now being written.
  ! fix, util.c: string copies in trim_spaces(), trim_all_spaces() and
    strip_quotes() have been rewritten more safely. Patch is courtesy of
    Dmitry Koplovich.
  ! fix, sfacctd: interface format is now merged back into interface value
    fields so to ease keeping track of discards (and discard reasons) and
    multicast fanout.
  ! fix, MySQL, SQLite3 plugins: sql table version 8 issued to provide
    common naming convention when mapping primitives to database fields
    among the supported RDBMS base. Thanks to Chris Wilson for his support.
  ! fix, pmacct client: numeric variables output converted to unsigned
    from signed.
  ! fix, nfacctd_net, sfacctd_net: default value changed from null (and
    related error message) to 'netflow' for nfacctd_net and 'sflow' for
    sfacctd_net.
  ! fix, nfacctd, sfacctd: aggregate_filter was not catching L2 primitives
    (VLAN, MAC addresses) when performing egress measurements.  

0.12.4 -- 01-10-2010
  + BGP daemon: a new memory model is introduced by which IP prefixes
    are being shared among the BGP peers RIBs - leading to consistent
    memory savings whenever multiple BGP peers export full tables due
    to the almost total overlap of information. Longest match nature
    of IP lookups required to raise BGP peer awareness of the lookup
    algorithm. Updated INTERNALS document to support estimation of the
    memory footprint of the daemon.
  + BGP daemon: a new bgp_table_peer_buckets configuration directive
    is introduced: per-peer routing information is attached to IP
    prefixes and now hashed onto buckets with conflict chains. This
    parameter sets the number of buckets of such hash structure; the
    value is directly related to the number of expected BGP peers,
    should never exceed such amount and is best set to 1/10 of the
    expected number of peers.
  + nfprobe: support has been added to export direction field (NetFlow
    v9 field type #61); its value, 0=ingress 1=egress, is determined
    via nfprobe_direction configuration directive.
  + nfacctd: introduced support for Cisco ASA bytes counter, NetFlow v9
    field type #85. Thanks to Ralf Reinartz for his support. 
  + nfacctd: improved flow recognition heuristics for cases in which
    IPv4/IPv6/input/output data are combined within the same NetFlow
    v9 template. Thanks to Carsten Schoene for his support.
  ! fix, BGP daemon: bgp_nexthop_followup was not working correctly if
    pointed to a non-existing next-hop.
  ! fix, nfv9_template.c: ignoring unsupported NetFlow v9 field types;
    improved template logging. Thanks to Ralf Reinartz for his support.
  ! fix, print plugin: support for interfaces and network masks has
    been added. Numeric variables output converted to unsigned from
    signed. 

0.12.3 -- 28-07-2010
  + 'cos' aggregation primitive has been implemented providing support
    for 802.1p priority. Collection is supported via sFlow, libpcap and
    ULOG; export is supported via sFlow. 
  + BGP daemon: TCP MD5 signature implemented. New 'bgp_daemon_md5_file'
    configuration directive is being added for the purpose of defining
    peers and their respective MD5 keys, one per line, in CSV format. 
    The map is reloadable at runtime: existing MD5 keys are removed via
    setsockopt(), new ones are installed as per the newly supplied map.
    Sample map added in 'examples/bgp_md5.lst.example'.
  + BGP daemon: added support for RFC3107 (SAFI=4 label information) to
    enable receipt of labeled IPv4/IPv6 unicast prefixes. 
  + nfprobe, sfprobe: introduced the concept of traffic direction. As a
    result, [ns]fprobe_direction and [ns]fprobe_ifindex configuration
    directives have been implemented. 
  + [ns]fprobe_direction defines traffic direction. It can be statically
    defined via 'in' or 'out' keywords; values can also be dynamically
    determined through a pre_tag_map (1=input, 2=output) by means of 
    'tag' and 'tag2' keywords.
  + [ns]fprobe_ifindex either statically associate an interface index
    (ifIndex) to a given [ns]fprobe plugin or semi-dynamically via
    lookups against a pre_tag_map by means of 'tag' and 'tag2' keywords.
  + sfprobe: sfprobe_ifspeed configuration directive is introduced and
    aimed at statically associating an interface speed to an sfprobe
    plugin. 
  + sfprobe: Switch Extension Header support added. Enabler for this
    development was support for 'cos' and in/out direction. Whereas
    VLAN information was already supported as an aggregation primitive.
  + sfprobe: added support for Counter Samples for multiple interfaces. 
    Sampling function has been brought to the plugin so that Counter
    Samples can be populated with real bytes/packets traffic levels.
  ! nfprobe, sfprobe: send buffer size is now aligned to plugin_pipe_size,
    if specified, providing a way to tune buffers in case of sustained
    exports.
  ! fix, addr.c: pm_ntohll() and pm_htonll() routines rewritten. These
    are aimed at changing byte ordering of 64-bit variables.
  ! fix, BGP daemon: support for IPv6 global address/link-local address
    next-hops as part of MP_REACH_NLRI parsing.
  ! fix, cfg_handlers.c: bgp_daemon and bgp_daemon_msglog parsing was
    not correct, ie. enabled if specified as 'false'. Thanks to Brent
    Van Dussen for reporting the issue.
  ! fix, bgp.c: found a CPU hog issue caused by missing cleanup of the
    select() descriptors vector. 
  ! fix, pmacct.c: in_iface/out_iface did erroneously fall inside a
    section protected by the "--disable-l2" switch. Thanks to Brent
    Van Dussen for reporting the issue.

0.12.2 -- 27-05-2010
  + A new 'tee' plugin is introduced bringing both NetFlow and sFlow
    replication capabilities to pmacct. It supports transparent mode
    (tee_transparent), coarse-grained filtering capabilities via the
    Pre-Tagging infrastructure. Quickstart guide is included as part
    of the EXAMPLES file (chapter XII).
  + nfprobe, sfprobe: introduced support for export of the BGP next-hop 
    information. Source data selection for BGP next-hop is being linked
    to [pmacctd_as|uacctd_as] configuration directive. Hence it must be
    set to 'bgp' in order for this feature to work.
  + nfprobe, sfprobe, BGP daemon: new set of features (nfprobe_ipprec,
    sfprobe_ipprec, bgp_daemon_ipprec) allows to mark self-originated
    sFlow, NetFlow and BGP datagrams with the supplied IP precedence
    value.
  + peer_src_ip (IP address of the NetFlow emitter, agent ID of the
    sFlow emitter) and peer_dst_ip (BGP next-hop) can now be filled
    from NetFlow/sFlow protocols data other than BGP. To activate the
    feature nfacctd_as_new/sfacctd_as_new have to be 'false' (default
    value), 'true' or 'file'.
  + print plugin: introduced support for Comma-Separated Values (CSV)
    output in addition to formatted-text. A new print_output feature
    allows to switch between the two.  
  + pmacctd: improved 802.1ad support. While recursing, outer VLAN is
    always reported as value of the 'vlan' primitive.
  ! fix, pmacctd: 802.1p was kept integral part of the 'vlan' value.
    Now a 0x0FFF mask is applied in order to return only the VLAN ID.
  ! fix, pkt_handlers.c: added trailing '\0' symbol when truncating
    AS-PATH and BGP community strings due to length constraints.
  ! fix, sql_common.c: maximum SQL writers warning message was never
    reached unless a recovery method is specifited. Thanks to Sergio
    Charpinel Jr for reporting the issue.
  ! fix, MySQL and PostgreSQL plugins: PGRES_TUPLES_OK (PostgreSQL)
    and errno 1050 (MySQL) are now considered valid return codes when
    dynamic tables are involved (ie. sql_table_schema). Thanks to
    Sergio Charpinel Jr for his support.
  ! fix, BGP daemon: pkt_bgp_primitives struct has been explicitely
    64-bit aligned. Mis-alignment was causing crashes when buffering
    was enabled (plugin_buffer_size). Verified on Solaris/sparc.

0.12.1 -- 07-04-2010
  + Input/output interfaces (SNMP indexes) have now been implemented
    natively; it's therefore not required anymore to pass through the
    (Pre-)tag infrastructure. As a result two aggregation primitives
    are being introduced: 'in_iface' and 'out_iface'.
  + Support for source/destination IP prefix masks is introduced via
    two new aggregation primitives: src_mask and dst_mask. These are
    populated as defined by the [nf|sf|pm|u]acctd_net directive:
    NetFlow/sFlow protocols, BGP, Network files (networks_file) or
    static (networks_mask) being valid data sources.
  + A generic tunnel inspection infrastructure has been developed to
    benefit both pmacctd and uacctd daemons. Handlers are defined via
    configuration file. Once enabled daemons will account basing upon
    tunnelled headers rather than the envelope. Currently the only
    supported tunnel protocol is GTP, the GPRS tunnelling protocol
    (which can be configured as: "tunnel_0: gtp, <UDP port>"). Up to
    8 different tunnel stacks and up to 4 tunnel layers per stack are
    supported. First matching stack, first matching layer wins.
  + uacctd: support for the MAC layer has been added for the Netlink/
    ULOG Linux packet capturing framework.
  + 'nfprobe_source_ip' feature introduced: it allows to select the
    IPv4/IPv6 address to be used to export NetFlow datagrams to the
    collector.
  + nfprobe, sfprobe: network masks are now exported via NetFlow and
    sFlow. 'pmacctd_net' and its equivalent directives define how to
    populate src_mask and dst_mask values.
  ! cleanup, nfprobe/sfprobe: data source for 'src_as' and 'dst_as'
    primitives is now expected to be always explicitely defined (in
    line with how 'src_net' and 'dst_net' primitives work). See the
    UPGRADE doc for the (limited) backward compatibility impact.
  ! Updated SQL documentation: sql/README.iface guides on 'in_iface'
    and 'out_iface' primitives; sql/README.mask guides on 'src_mask'
    and 'dst_mask' primitives; sql/README.is_symmetric guides on
    'is_symmetric' primitive. 
  ! fix, nfacctd.h: source and destination network masks were twisted
    in the NetFlow v5 export structure definition. Affected releases
    are: 0.12.0rc4 and 0.12.0.
  ! fix, nfprobe_plugin.c: l2_to_flowrec() was missing some variable
    declaration when the package was configured for compilation with
    --disable-l2. Thanks to Brent Van Dussen for reporting the issue. 
  ! fix, bgp.c: bgp_attr_munge_as4path() return code was not defined
    for some cases. This was causing some BGP messages to be marked
    as malformed.
  ! fix, sfprobe: a dummy MAC layer was created whenever this was not
    included as part of the captured packet. This behaviour has been
    changed and header protocol is now set to 11 (IPv4) or 12 (IPv6)
    accordingly. Thanks to Neil McKee for pointing the issue. 
  ! workaround, building sub-system: PF_RING enabled libpcap was not
    recognized due to missing of pcap_dispatch(). This is now fixed. 

0.12.0 -- 16-02-2010
  + 'is_symmetric' aggregation primitive has been implemented: aimed
    at easing detection of asymmetric traffic. It's based on rule
    definitions supplied in a 'bgp_is_symmetric_map' map, reloadable
    at runtime.
  + A new 'bgp_daemon_allow_file' configuration directive allows to
    specify IP addresses that can establish a BGP session with the
    collector's BGP thread. Many thanks to Erik van der Burg for
    contributing the idea.
  + 'nfacctd_ext_sampling_rate' and 'sfacctd_ext_sampling_rate' are
    introduced: they flag the daemon that captured traffic is being
    sampled. Useful to tackle corner cases, ie. the sampling rate
    reported by the NetFlow/sFlow agent is missing or incorrect.
  + The 'bgp_follow_nexthop' feature has been extended so that extra
    IPv4/IPv6 prefixes can be supplied. Up to 32 IP prefixes are now
    supported and a warning message is generated whenever a supplied
    string fails parsing.
  + Pre-Tagging: implemented 'src_local_pref' and 'src_comms' keys.
    These allow tagging based on source IP prefix local_pref (sourced
    from either a map or BGP, ie. 'bgp_src_local_pref_type: map',
    'bgp_src_local_pref_type: bgp') and standard BGP communities.
  + Pre-Tagging: 'src_peer_as' key was extended in order to match on
    BGP-sourced data (bgp_peer_src_as_type: bgp).
  + Pre-Tagging: introduced 'comms' key to tag basing on up to 16
    standard BGP communities attached to the destination IP prefix.
    The lookup is done against the BGP RIB of the exporting router.
    Comparisons can be done in either match-any or match-all fashion;
    xidDocumentation and examples updated.
  ! fix, util.c: load_allow_file(), empty allow file was granting a
    connection to everybody being confused with a 'no map' condition.
    Now this case is properly recognized and correctly translates in
    a reject all clause.
  ! fix, sql_common.c: log of NetFlow micro-flows to a SQL database
    (nfacctd_sql_log directive) was not correctly getting committed
    to the backend, when sql_history was disabled.
  ! fix, mysql|pgsql|sqlite_plugin.c: 'flows' aggregation primitive
    was not suitable to mix-and-match with BGP related primitives
    (ie. peer_dst_as, etc.) due to an incorrect check. Many thanks
    to Zenon Mousmoulas for the bug report.
  ! fix, pretag_handlers.c: tagging against NetFlow v9 4-bytes in/out
    interfaces was not working properly. Thanks to Zenon Mousmoulas
    for reporting the issue.

0.12.0rc4 -- 21-12-2009
  + BGP-related source primitives are introduced, namely: src_as_path,
    src_std_comm, src_ext_comm, src_local_pref and src_med. These add
    to peer_src_as which was already implemented. All can be resolved
    via reverse BGP lookups; peer_src_as, src_local_pref and src_med
    can also be resolved via lookup maps which support checks like:
    bgp_nexthop (RPF), peer_dst_as (RPF), input interface and source
    MAC address. Many thanks to Zenon Mousmoulas and GRNET for their
    fruitful cooperation.
  + Memory structures to store BGP-related primitives have been
    optimized. Memory is now allocated only for primitives part of
    the selected aggregation profile ('aggregate' config directive).
  + A new 'bgp_follow_nexthop' configuration directive is introduced
    to follow the BGP next-hop up to the edge of the routing domain.
    This is particularly aimed at networks not running MPLS, where
    hop-by-hop routing is in place.
  + Lookup maps for BGP-related source primitives (bgp_src_med_map,
    bgp_peer_src_as_map, bgp_src_local_pref_map): result of check(s)
    can now be the keyword 'bgp', ie. 'id=bgp' which triggers a BGP
    lookup. This is thought to handle exceptions to static mapping.
  + A new 'bgp_peer_as_skip_subas' configuration directive is being
    introduced. When computing peer_src_as and peer_dst_as, returns
    the first ASN which is not part of a BGP confederation; if only
    confederated ASNs are on the AS-Path, the first one is returned
    instead.
  + Pre-Tagging: support has been introduced for NetFlow v9 traffic
    direction (ingress/egress). 
  + Network masks part of NetFlow/sFlow export protocols can now be
    used to compute src_net, dst_net and sum_net primitives. As a
    result a set of directives [nfacctd|sfacctd|pmacctd|uacctd]_net
    allows to globally select the method to resolve such primitives,
    valid values being: netflow, sflow, file (networks_file), mask
    (networks_mask) and bgp (bgp_daemon).
  + uacctd: introduced support for input/output interfaces, fetched
    via NetLink/ULOG API; interfaces are available for Pre-Tagging,
    and inclusion in NetFlow and sFlow exports. The implementation
    is courtesy of Stig Thormodsrud.
  + nfprobe, sfprobe: new [nfprobe|sfprobe]_peer_as option to set
    source/destination ASNs, part of the NetFlow and sFlow exports,
    to the peer-AS rather than origin-AS. This feature depends on a
    working BGP daemon thread setup.
  ! A few resource leaks were detected and fixed. Patch is courtesy
    of Eric Sesterhenn.
  ! bgp/bgp.c: thread concurrency was detected upon daemon startup
    under certain conditions. As a solution the BGP thread is being
    granted a time advantage over the traffic collector thread. 
  ! bgp/bgp.c: fixed a security issue which could have allowed a
    malicious user to disrupt established working BGP sessions by
    exploiting the implemented concept of BGP session replenishment;
    this has been secured by a check against the session holdtime.
    Many thanks to Erik van der Burg for spotting the issue.
  ! bgp/bgp.c: BGP listener socket now sets SO_REUSEADDR option for
    quicker turn around times while stopping/starting the daemon. 
  ! net_aggr.c: default route (0.0.0.0/0) was considered invalid;
    this is now fixed.

0.12.0rc3 -- 28-10-2009
  + Support for NetFlow v9 sampling via Option templates and
    data is introduced; this is twofold: a) 'nfacctd_renormalize'
    configuration directive is now able to renormalize NetFlow v9
    data on-the-fly by performing Option templates management; b)
    'nfprobe', the NetFlow probe plugin, is able to flag sampling
    rate (either internal or external) when exporting flows to the
    collector. 
  + '[pm|u]acctd_ext_sampling_rate' directives are introduced to
    support external sampling rate scenarios: packet selection is
    performed by the underlying packect capturing framework, ie.
    ULOG, PF_RING. Making the daemon aware of the sampling rate,
    allows to renormalize or export such information via NetFlow
    or sFlow.
  + pmacctd: the IPv4/IPv6 fragment handler engine was reviewed
    to make it sampling-friendly. The new code hooks get enabled
    when external sampling (pmacctd_ext_sampling_rate) is defined.
  + A new 'uacctd' daemon is added to the set; it is based on the
    Netlink ULOG packet capturing framework; this implies it works
    only on Linux and can be optionally enabled when compling by
    defining the '--enable-ulog' switch. The implementation is
    fully orthogonal with the existing feature set. Thanks very
    much to: A.O. Prokofiev for contributing the original idea
    and code; Stig Thormodsrud for his support and review. 
  + The 'tag2' primitive is introduced. Its aim is to support
    traffic matrix scenarios by giving a second field dedicated
    to tag traffic. In a pre_tag_map this can be employed via the
    'id2' key. See examples in the 'examples/pretag.map.example' 
    document. SQL plugins write 'tag2' content in the 'agent_id2'
    field. Read 'sql/README.agent_id2' document for reference. 
  + Some new directives to control and re-define file attributes
    written by the pmacct daemons, expecially when launched with
    increased priviledges, are introduced: file_umask, files_uid,
    files_gid. Files to which these apply include, ie. pidfile,
    logfile and BGP neighbors file.
  ! fix, bgp/bgp.c: upon reaching bgp_daemon_max_peers threshold,
    logs were flooded by warnings even when messages were coming
    from a previously accepted BGP neighbor. Warnings are now sent
    only when a new BGP connection is refused.
  ! fix, nfprobe/netflow9.c: tags (pre_tag_map, post_tag) were set
    per pair of flows, not respecting their uni-directional nature.
    It was generating hiding of some tags.
  ! fix, nfprobe/netflow9.c: templates were (wrongly) not being
    included in the count of flows sent in NetFlow v9 datagrams.
    While this was not generating any issues with parsing flows,
    it was originating visualization issues in Wireshark.
  ! fix, SQL plugins: CPU hitting 100% has been determined when
    sql_history is disabled but sql_history_roundoff is defined.
    Thanks to Charlie Allom for reporting the issue.
  ! fix, sfacctd.c: input and output interfaces (non-expaneded
    format) were not correcly decoded creating issues to Pre-
    tagging. Thanks to Jussi Sjostrom for reporting the issue.

0.12.0rc2 -- 09-09-2009
  + BGP daemon thread has been tied up with both the NetFlow and
    sFlow probe plugins, nfprobe and sfprobe, allowing to encode
    dynamic ASN information (src_as, dst_as) instead of reading
    it from text files. This finds special applicability within
    open-source router solutions.
  + 'bgp_stdcomm_pattern_to_asn' feature is introduced: filters
    BGP standard communities against the supplied pattern. The
    first matching community is split using the ':' symbol. The
    first part is mapped onto the peer AS field while the second
    is mapped onto the origin AS field. The aim is to deal with
    prefixes on the own address space. Ie. BGP standard community
    XXXXX:YYYYY is mapped as: Peer-AS=XXXXX, Origin-AS=YYYYY.
  + 'bgp_neighbors_file' feature is introduced: writes a list of
    the BGP neighbors in the established state to the specified
    file. This gets particularly useful for automation purposes
    (ie. auto-discovery of devices to poll via SNMP).
  + 'bgp_stdcomm_pattern' feature was improved by supporting the
    regex '.' symbol which can be used to wildcard a pre-defined
    number of characters, ie. '65534:64...' will match community
    values in the range 64000-64999 only.
  + SQL preprocess layer: removed dependency between actions and
    checks. Overral logics was reviewed to act more consistently
    with recently introduced SQL cache entry status field.
  + SQL common layer: poll() timeout is now calculated adaptively
    for increased deadline precision. 
  + sql_startup_delay feature functionality was improved in order
    to let it work as a sliding window to match NetFlow setups in
    which a) mainain original flow timestamps and b) enable the
    sql_dont_try_update feature is required.
  ! DST (Daylight Saving Time) support introduced to sql_history
    and sql_refresh_time directives. Thanks to <alshu@tut.by> for
    reporting the issue.
  ! fix, pmacctd.c: initial sfprobe plugin checks were disabling
    IP fragments handler. This was causing pmacctd to crash under
    certain conditions. Thanks to Stig Thormodsrud for having
    reported the issue.
  ! fix, nfprobe, netflow5.c: missing htons() call while encoding
    src_as primitive. 
  ! fix, BGP thread, bgp_aspath.c: estimated AS-PATH length was
    not enough for 32-bit ASNs. String length per-ASN increased
    from 5 to 10 chars.
  ! Documentation update, EXAMPLES: how to establish a local BGP
    peering between pmacctd and Quagga 0.99.14 for NetFlow and
    sFlow probe purposes.
  ! fix, print_status_table(): SEGV was showing up while trying
    to retrieve xFlow statistics by sending a SIGUSR1 signal and
    a collector IP address was not configured.
  ! ip_flow.[c|h]: code cleanup.

0.12.0rc1 -- 01-08-2009
  + a BGP daemon thread has been integrated in both the NetFlow
    and sFlow collectors, nfacctd and sfacctd. It maintains per-
    peer RIBs and supports MP-BGP (IPv4, IPv6) and 32-bit ASNs.
    As a result the following configuration directives are being
    introduced: bgp_daemon, bgp_daemon_ip, bgp_daemon_max_peers,
    bgp_daemon_port and bgp_daemon_msglog. For a quick-start and
    implementation notes refer to EXAMPLES document and detailed
    configuration directives description in CONFIG-KEYS.
  + A new set of BGP-related aggregation primitives are now
    supported by the "aggregate" directive: std_comm, ext_comm,
    as_path, peer_src_ip, peer_dst_ip, peer_src_as, peer_dst_as,
    med, local_pref. A few extra directives are being introduced
    to support (filter, map, cut down, etc.) some primitives:
    bgp_peer_src_as_type, bgp_peer_src_as_map, bgp_aspath_radius, 
    bgp_stdcomm_pattern and bgp_extcomm_pattern.
  + nfacctd_as_new supports a new value "bgp". It is meant to
    populate src_as and dst_as primitives by looking up source
    and destination IP prefixes against the NetFlow (or sFlow)
    agent RIB. 
  + A new sql_table_type directive is introduced: by combining
    it with sql_table_version, defines one of the standard BGP
    tables. 
  + Two new directives have been developed to support scenarios
    where NetFlow (or sFlow) agents are not running BGP or have
    default-only or partial views: bgp_follow_default and
    bgp_agent_map.
  + 4-bytes ASNs are now supported: including NetFlow and sFlow
    collectors, NetFlow and sFlow probes, networks_file to map
    prefixes to ASNs. The new BGP daemon implementation is, of
    course, fully compliant.  
  + Pre-Tagging: the ID is now a 32-bit unsigned value (it was
    16-bit). As a result, there valid tags can be in the range
    1-4294967295 and maps can now express the resulting ID as
    an IPv4 address (ie. bgp_agent_map).  
  + Pre-tagging: support for 32-bit input/output interfaces is
    now available.
  ! fix, sql_common.c: read_SQLquery_from_file() was returning
    a random value, regardless of the successful result. Patch
    has been provided provided by Giedrius Liubavicius
  ! fix, pmacct.c: when unused, source/destination IP address
    fields were presented as NULL values. This is now replaced
    with a '0' value to improve output parsing.
  ! Standard major release compilation check-pointing: thanks
    very much to Manuel Pata and Tobias Lott for their strong
    support with OpenBSD and FreeBSD respectively.

0.11.6 -- 07-04-2009
  + Introduced support for tag ranges into the 'pre_tag_filter' 
    configuration directive (ie. '10-20' matches traffic tagged
    in the range 10..20). This works both in addition to and in
    combination with negations.
  + Tcpdump-style filters, ie. 'aggregate_filter', now support
    indexing within a packet, ie. 'ether[12:2]', to allow a more
    flexible separation of the traffic.
  + Introduced support for descriptions in networks definition
    files pointed by the 'networks_file' configuration directive.
    Thanks to Karl O. Pinc for contributing the patch.
  ! fix, pmacctd: libpcap DLT_LINUX_SLL type is not defined in
    older versions of the library. It was preventing successful
    compilation of pmacct on OpenBSD. This has been fixed by
    defining internally to pmacct all DLT types in use. Thanks
    to Karl O. Pinc for his support.
  ! fix, IPv6 networks_file, load_networks6(): wrong masks were
    applied to IPv6 networks due to dirty temporary buffers for
    storing IPv6 addresses and masks. Short '::' IPv6 format is
    currently not supported. Thanks to Robert Blechinger for
    flagging the issue.
  ! fix, pretag.c: Pre-Tagging infrastructure was SEGV'ing after
    having been instructed to reload via a SIGHUP signal. Patch
    is courtesy of Denis Cavrois and the Acipia development team.
  ! fix, sfacctd, nfacctd: Assign16() was not handling correctly
    2-bytes EtherType values (ie. 0x86dd, 0x8847) in 802.1Q tags.
    As a result 'aggregate_filter' was not able to correctly match
    IPv6-related filters. Thanks to Axel Apitz for reporting the
    issue.
  ! fix, xflow_status.c: a cosmetic bug was displaying sequence
    numbers without applying previous increment. This definitely
    will help troubleshooting and debugging.
  ! fix, sfacctd, sfv245_check_status(): AF of the sFlow agent
    is now explicitely defined: when IPv6 is enabled the remote
    peer address can be reported as IPv4-mapped IPv6 address. This
    was causing warning messages to report the wrong sFlow agent
    IP address. Thanks to Axel Apitz for reporting the issue.
  ! fix, IMT plugin was crashing upon receipt of a classification
    table request (WANT_CLASS_TABLE) when stream classification
    was actually disabled.
  ! fix, pmacct.c: classifier index was not brought back to zero
    by the pmacct client. This was preventing the client to show
    correct stream classification when it was feeded with multiple
    queries. The fix is courtesy of Fabio Cairo.
  ! fix, MySQL plugin: upon enabling of the 'nfacctd_sql_log'
    directive, 'stamp_updated' field was incorrectly reported
    as '0000-00-00 00:00:00' due to wrong field formatting. Thanks
    to Brett D'Arcy for reporting and patching the issue.
  ! Initial effort to clean the code up by strcpy() calls. Thanks
    to Karl O. Pinc for taking such initiative.

0.11.5 -- 21-07-2008
  + SQL UPDATE queries code has been rewritten for increased
    flexibility. The SET statement is now a vector and part of
    it has been shifted into the sql_compose_static_set() routine
    in the common SQL layer.
  + A new sql_locking_style directive is now supported in the
    MySQL plugin. To exploit it, an underlying InnoDB table is
    mandatory. Thanks to Matt Gillespie for his tests.
  + Support for Endace DAG cards is now available; this has been
    tested against libDAG 3.0.0. Many thanks to Robert Blechinger
    for his extensive support.
  + pmacctd, the Linux Cooked device (DLT_LINUX_SLL) handler has
    been enhanced by supporting 'src_mac' and 'vlan' aggregation
    primitives.
  ! fix, xflow_status.c: NetFlow/sFlow collector's IP address is
    being rewritten as 0.0.0.0 when NULL. Was causing SEGVs on
    Solaris/sparc.
  ! fix, server.c: WANT_RESET is copied in order to avoid losing
    it when handling long queries and need to fragment the reply.
    Thanks very much to Ruben Laban for his support.
  ! fix, MySQL plugin: the table name is now escaped in order to
    not conflict with reserved words, if one of those is selected.
    Thanks to Marcel Hecko for reporting the bug.
  ! An extra security check is being introduced in sfacctd as an
    unsupported extension sent over by a Foundry Bigiron 4000 kit
    was causing SEGV issues. Many Thanks to Michael Hoffrath for
    the strong support provided.
  ! fix, 'nfprobe' plugin: AS numbers were not correctly exported
    to the collector when pmacctd was in use. Patch is courtesy of
    Emerson Pinter.
  ! fix, 'nfprobe' plugin: MACs were not properly encapsulated
    resulting in wrong addresses being exported through NetFlow
    v9. The patch is courtesy of Alexander Bergolth.
  ! fix, buffers holding MAC address strings throughout the code
    had not enough space to store the trailing zero. The patch is
    courtesy of Alexander Bergolth.
  ! fix, logfile FD was not correctly passed onto active plugins.
    The patch is courtesy of Denis Cavrois.
  ! Missing field type 60 in NetFlow v9 IPv6 flows, was leading
    nfacctd to incorrect flow type selection (IPv4). An additional
    check on the source IP address has now been included to infer
    IPv6 flows. RFC3954 mandates such field type to be present for
    IPv6 flows. The issue has been verified against a Cisco 7600
    w/ RSP720. Many thanks to Robert Blechinger for his extensive
    support.

0.11.4 -- 25-04-2007
  + support for TCP flags has been introduced. Flags are ORed on a
    per-aggregate basis (same as what NetFlow does on a per-flow
    basis). The 'aggregate' directive now supports the 'tcpflags'
    keyword. SQL tables v7 have also been introduced in order to
    support the feature inside the SQL plugins. 
  + 'nfacctd_sql_log' directive is being introduced. In nfacctd,
    it makes SQL plugins to use a) NetFlow's First Switched value
    as "stamp_inserted" timestamp and b) Last Switched value as
    "stamp_updated" timestamp. Then, a) by not aggregating flows
    and b) not making use of timeslots, this directive allows to
    log singular flows in the SQL database.
  + sfprobe and nfprobe plugins are now able to propagate tags to
    remote collectors through sFlow v5 and NetFlow v9 protocols. 
    The 'tag' key must be appended to sfprobe/nfprobe 'aggregate'
    config directives.
  + pmacct memory client is now able to output either TopN bytes,
    flows or packets statistics. The feature is enabled by a new
    '-T' commandline switch.
  + The Pre-Tagging map is now dynamically allocated and a new
    'pre_tag_map_entries' config directive allows to set the size
    of the map. Its default value (384) should be suitable for
    most common scenarios.
  ! Bugfix in nfprobe plugin: struct cb_ctxt was not initialized
    thus causing the application to exit prematurely (thinking it
    finished available memory). Thanks to Elio Eraseo for fixing
    the issue.
  ! Some misplaced defines were preventing 0.11.3 code to compile
    smoothly on OpenBSD boxes. Thanks to Dmitry Moshkov for fixing
    it.
  ! Bugfix in SQL handlers, MY_count_ip_proto_handler(): an array
    boundary was not properly checked and could cause the daemon
    to SEGV receiving certain packets. Thanks to Dmitry Frolov for 
    debugging and fixing the issue.
  ! NF_counters_renormalize_handler() renormalizes sampled NetFlow
    v5 flows. It now checks whether a positive Sampling Rate value
    is defined rather than looking for the Sampling Mode. It makes
    the feature working on Juniper routers. Thanks once again to
    Inge Bjornvall Arnesen.

0.11.3 -- 31-01-2007
  + 'aggregate_filter' directive now supports multiple pcap-style
    filters, comma separated. This, in turn, allows to bind up to
    128 filters to each activated plugin.
  + nfacctd and sfacctd turn-back time when restarting the daemon
    has been significantly improved by both creating new listening
    sockets with SO_REUSEADDR option and disassociating them first
    thing on receiving SIGINT signal. 
  + A new threaded version of pmacctd stream classification engine  
    is being introduced. Code status is experimental and disabled
    by default; it could be enabled by providing --enable-threads
    at configure time. Many thanks to Francois Deppierraz and Eneo
    Tecnologia for contributing this useful piece of code. 
  + A new 'flow_handling_threads' configuration directive allows to
    set the number of threads of the stream classification engine,
    by default 10.
  + A couple new '[ns]facctd_disable_checks' config directives aim
    to disable health checks over incoming NetFlow/sFlow streams
    (ie. in cases of non-standard vendor's implementations). Many 
    thanks to Andrey Chernomyrdin for his patch.
  ! sfv245_check_status() was running checks (ie. verify sequence
    numbers) using sender's IP address. More correctly, it has to
    look at the Agent Address field included in sFlow datagrams.
    Many thanks to Juraj Sucik for spotting the issue. 
  ! nfprobe plugin was not compiling properly in conjunction with
    --disable-l2 configure switch. Many thanks to Inge Bjornvall
    Arnesen for submitting the patch.
  ! sfacctd: fixed a bug which was preventing 'aggregate_filter'
    to match values properly in src_port, dst_port, ip proto and
    tos fields. Thanks to Chris Fletcher for spotting the issue.
  ! SQL cache: fixed a bug preventing safe actions to take place
    correctly. It has arisen in version 0.11.2 and hadn't severe
    impact.

0.11.2 -- 28-11-2006
  + 'sql_max_writers' configuration directive is being introduced:
    sets the maximum number of concurrent writer processes the SQL
    plugin can fire, allowing the daemon to degrade gracefully in
    case of major database unavailibility.
  + 'sql_history_since_epoch' is being introduced: enables the use
    of timestamps (stamp_inserted, stamp_updated) in the standard
    seconds since the Epoch format as an alternative to the default
    date-time format. 
  + 'sql_aggressive_classification' behaviour is changed: simpler
    more effective. It now operates by delaying cache-to-DB purge
    of unknown traffic streams - which would still have chances to
    be correctly classified - for a few 'sql_refresh_time' slots.
    The old mechanism was making use of negative UPDATE queries.
  + The way SQL writer processes are spawned by the SQL plugin has
    slightly changed in order to better exploit fork()'s copy-on-
    write behaviour: the writer now is mostly read-only while the
    plugin does most write operations before spawning the writer.
  ! The list of environment variables passed to the SQL triggers,
    'sql_trigger_exec', has been updated.
  ! Fixed a bug related to sequence number checks for NetFlow v5
    datagrams. Thanks very much to Peter Nixon for reporting it.

0.11.1 -- 25-10-2006
  + PostgreSQL plugin: 'sql_use_copy' configuration directive has
    been introduced; instructs the plugin to build non-UPDATE SQL
    queries using COPY (in place of INSERT). While providing same
    functionalities of INSERT, COPY is more efficient. It requires
    'sql_dont_try_update' to be enabled. Thanks to Arturas Lapiene
    for his support during the development.
  + nfprobe plugin: support for IPv4 ToS/DSCP, IPv6 CoS and MPLS
    top-most label has been introduced. 
  ! Some alignment issues concerning both pkt_extras structure and
    Core process to Plugins memory rings have been fixed. Daemons
    are now reported to be running ok on MIPS/SPARC architectures.
    Many thanks to Michal Krzysztofowicz for his strong support.
  ! sfprobe plugin: a maximum default limit of 256 bytes is set
    on packet payload copy when building Flow Samples in pmacctd
    (ie. if capturing full packets through libpcap, we don't want
    them to be entirely copied into sFlow datagrams).
  ! Sanity checks now take place when processing 'sql_refresh_time'
    values and error messages are thrown out.
  ! Fixes have been committed to IPv6 code in xflow_status.c as it
    was not compiling properly on both Solaris and IRIX.

0.11.0 -- 27-09-2006
  + NetFlow v5 sampling and renormalization are now supported:
    a) 'nfacctd' is able to renormalize bytes/packets counters and
    apply Pre-Tagging basing on the sampling rate specified in the
    datagram; b) 'sampling_rate' config key applies to 'nfprobe'
    plugin which is now able to generate sampling informations.
  + 'nfacctd' and 'sfacctd' are now able to give out informations
    about the status of active NetFlow/sFlow streams in terms of
    good/bad/missing datagrams. Whenever an anomaly happens (ie.
    missing or bad packets) a detailed message is logged; overral
    reports are logged by sending SIGUSR1 signals to the daemon. 
  + 'logfile' configuration directive is introduced: it allows to
    log directly to custom files. This adds to console and syslog
    logging options.
  ! Old renormalization structure, renorm_table, has been dropped;
    the new one, which applies to both NetFlow and sFlow, is tied
    into the brand new xflow_status_table structure. 
  ! When 'nfacctd_as_new' was not in use, NetFlow v5 src_as/dst_as
    values were erroneously swapped. Thanks to Thomas Stegbauer
    for reporting the bug.
  ! Incorrect timeout value for poll() has been fixed in 'sfprobe'
    plugin. It was leading the plugin to take too much resources.
  ! 'nfprobe' plugin was inserting jumps while generating sequence
    numbers.
  ! 'nfprobe' plugin behaviour in handling 'networks_file' content
    has been changed and now equals 'sfprobe': IP addresses which
    are not belonging to known networks/ASNs are no longer zeroed. 
  ! 'sfprobe' was not generating correct sample_pool values.
    
0.11.0rc3 -- 30-08-2006
  + 'sfprobe' plugin can now transport packet/flow classification
    tags inside sFlow v5 datagrams. Then, such tags can be read by
    the sFlow collector, sfacctd. 
  + 'sfprobe' plugin is able to encapsulate basic Extended Gateway
    informations (src_as, dst_as) into sFlow v5 datagrams starting
    from a Networks File - networks_file configuration directive.
  + 'nfprobe' now supports network data coming from libpcap/tcpdump
    style savefile ('pcap_savefile', -I). 
  + pmacctd is now able to capture packets from DLT_NULL, which is
    BSD loopback encapsulation link type. Thanks to Gert Burger for
    his support.
  + Sampling layer has been improved: it's now able to sample flows
    from NetFlow datagrams (not only packets arriving through sFlow
    or libpcap); 'sfprobe' sampling layer has been tied into this
    mechanism and as a result, 'sfprobe_sampling_rate' is now an
    alias for 'sampling_rate' and its default value is 1 (ie. no
    sampling). This change will benefit 'sfprobe' in terms of better
    efficiency.
  + A new 'pmacctd_flow_buffer_buckets' directive defines the number
    of buckets of the Flow Buffer. This value has to scale to higher
    power of 2 accordingly to the link traffic rate and is useful
    when packet classification is enabled. Many thanks for testing,
    debugging and support go to Steve Cliffe. 
  + A new 'sql_locking_style' directive allows to choose among two
    types of locking: "table" (default) and "row". More details are
    in the CONFIG-KEYS document. "row" locking has to be considered
    as experimental. Many thanks go to Aaron Glenn and Peter Nixon
    for their close support, work and thoughts.
  ! IPv6 support is now working; it was broken in 0.11.0rc2; thanks
    to Nigel Roberts for signalling and fixing the issue. 
  ! Fixed a few issues concerning the building system and related to 
    the introduction of some new subtrees. Thanks to Kirill Ponomarew
    and Peter Nixon for signalling them.
  ! Fixed some signal()-related issues when running the package under
    DragonflyBSD. Being fork of FreeBSD 4.x, it needs same cautions. 
    Thanks to Aaron Glenn for his support.

0.11.0rc2 -- 08-08-2006
  + 'nfprobe' plugin can now transport packet/flow classification
    tags inside NetFlow v9 datagrams, using custom field type 200.
    Then, such tags can be read by the NetFlow collector, nfacctd.  
  + 'nfprobe' plugin has now ability to select a Engine Type/Engine 
    ID through a newly introduced 'nfprobe_engine' config directive.
    It will mainly allow a collector to distinguish between distinct
    probe instances originating from the same IP address.
  + 'nfprobe' plugin now can automagically select different NetFlow
    v9 template IDs, useful when multiple 'nfprobe' plugins run as
    part of the same daemon instance. 
  + 'sfprobe' plugin is now able to redistribute NetFlow flows into
    sFlow samples. This adds to sFlow -> sFlow and libpcap -> sFlow.
  + A new data structure to pass extended data to specific plugins
    has been added. It is placed on the ring, next to pkt_data. It
    is meant to pass extra data to plugins and, same time, avoiding
    to inflate the main data structure.
  ! Wrong arguments were injected into a recently introduced Log()
    call in plugin_hooks.c; it's now fixed: under certain conditions,
    this was generating SEGV at startup while using 'sfprobe' plugin.  
  ! Updated documentation; examples and quickstart guides for using
    pmacct as both emitter and collector of NetFlow and sFlow have 
    been added.
  - Hooks to compile pmacct the no-mmap() style have been removed.

0.11.0rc1 -- 20-07-2006
  + pmacct DAEMONS ARE NOW ABLE TO CREATE AND EXPORT NETFLOW PACKETS:
    a new 'nfprobe' plugin is available and allows to create NetFlow
    v1/v5/v9 datagrams and export them to a IPv4/IPv6 collector. The
    work is based on softflowd 0.9.7 software. A set of configuration
    directives allows to tune timeouts (nfprobe_timeouts), cache size
    (nfprobe_maxflows), collector parameters (nfprobe_receiver), TTL
    value (nfprobe_hoplimit) and NetFlow version of the datagrams to
    be exported (nfprobe_version). Many thanks to Ivan A. Beveridge,
    Peter Nixon and Sven Anderson for their support and thoughts and
    to Damien Miller, author of softflowd.
  + pmacct DAEMONS ARE NOW ABLE TO CREATE AND EXPORT SFLOW PACKETS:  
    a new 'sfprobe' plugin is available and allows to create sFlow 
    v5 datagrams and export them to a IPv4 collector. The work is
    based on InMon sFlow Agent 5.6 software. A set of configuration
    directives allows to tune sampling rate (sfprobe_sampling_rate),
    sFlow agent IP address (sfprobe_agentip), collector parameters
    (sfprobe_receiver) and agentSubId value (sfprobe_agentsubid). 
    Many thanks to InMon for their software and Ivan A. Beveridge
    for his support.
  ! An incorrect pointer to the received packet was preventing Pre-
    Tagging filters to work correctly against DLT_LINUX_SLL links.
    Many thanks to Zhuang Yuyao for reporting the issue.
  ! Proper checks on protocol number were missing in pmacct client
    program, allowing to look further the bounds of the _protocols
    array. Many thanks to Denis N. Voituk for patching the issue.

0.10.3 -- 21-06-2006 
  + New Pre-Tagging key 'label': mark the rule with label's value.
    Labels don't need to be unique: when jumping, the first matching
    label wins. 
  + New Pre-Tagging key 'jeq': Jump on EQual. Jumps to the supplied
    label in case of rule match. Before jumping, the tagged flow is
    returned to active plugins, as it happens for any regular match
    (set return=false to change this). In case of multiple matches
    for a signle flow, plugins showing 'tag' key inside 'aggregate'
    directive will receive each tagged copy; plugins not receiving
    tags will still receive unique copy of the flow. 
    sFlow and NetFlow are usually uni-directional, ie. ingress-only
    or egress-only (to avoid duplicates). Meaningful application of
    JEQs is tagging flows two times: by incoming interface and by
    outgoing one. Only forward jumps are allowed. "next" is reserved
    label and causes to jump to the next rule. Many thanks to Aaron 
    Glenn for brainstormings about this point. 
  + New Pre-Tagging key 'return': if set to 'true' (which is default
    behaviour) returns the current packet/flow to active plugins, in
    case of match. If switched to 'false', it will prevent this to
    happen. It might be thought either as an extra filtering layer
    (bound to explicit Pre-Tagging rules) or (also in conjunction with
    'stack') as a way to add flexibility to JEQs.
  + New Pre-Tagging key 'stack': actually '+' (ie. sum symbol) is the
    unique supported value. This key makes sense only if JEQs are in
    use. When matching, accumulate IDs, using the specified operator/
    function. For example, usually <tag>=<currentID>. By setting
    'stack=+' you will be able to get <tag>=<previousID + currentID>.
  ! Pre-Tagging table now supports a maximum of 384 rules. Because
    of the newly introduced flow alteration features, tables are
    no longer internally re-ordered. However, IPv4 and IPv6 stacks
    are still segregated each other.

0.10.2 -- 16-05-2006
  + A new '-l' option is supported by pmacct client tool: it allows
    to enable locking of the memory table explicitely, when serving
    the requested operation. 
  + Pre-Tagging infrastructure is now featuring negations for almost
    all supported keys with the exclusion of id, ip and filter. To
    negate, the '-' (minus symbol) need to be prepended; eg.: id=X
    ip=Y in=-1 means tag with X, data received from Net/sFlow agent
    with IP address Y and not coming from interface 1.
  + pre_tag_filter config directive is now featuring same negation
    capabilities as Pre-Tagging infrastructure.
  + Q16 added to FAQS document: a sum of tips for running smoothly
    SQL tables. Many thanks to Wim Kerkhoff and Sven Anderson for
    bringing up the points. 

0.10.1 -- 18-04-2006
  + AS numbers and IP addresses are no more multiplexed into the same
    field. This ends the limitation of being unable to have both data
    types in the same table (which could be useful for troubleshooting
    purposes, for example). A new SQL table version, v6, is introduced
    in order to support this new data model in all SQL plugins.  
  ! Minor fixes to PostgreSQL table schemas, v2 to v5: a) the 'vlan'
    field was erroneously missing from primary keys, slowing down
    INSERT and UPDATE queries; b) primary keys were identified as
    'acct_pk', thus not allowing multiple tables of different version
    to share the same database; now constraint name is: 'acct_vX_pk',
    with X being the version number. Many thanks to Sven Anderson for
    catching the a)
  ! An alignment issue has been catched when the etheraddr_string() 
    gets called from count_src|dst_mac_handlers() in sql_handlers.c
    This seems to be closely connected to a similar trouble catched
    by Daniel Streicher on x86_64 recently.
  ! Fixed an issue with mask_elem() in server.c . Both src|dst_net
    primitives were not (positively, ie. copied back when required)
    masked.  

0.10.0 -- 22-03-2006
  + Collectors (ie. pmacctd) are now compiled exporting full Dynamic
    Symbol Table. This allows shared object (SO) classifiers to call
    routines included in the collector code. Moreover, a small set
    of library functions - specifically aimed to deal smoothly with
    the classifiers' table - are now included in the collector code:
    pmct_un|register(), pmct_find_first|last_free(), pmct_isfree(),
    pmct_get() and pmct_get_num_entries(). For further reading, take
    a look to README.developers document in classifiers tarball.
  + Classifiers table, which is the linked-list structure containing
    all the active classifiers (RE + SO), is now loaded into a shared
    memory segment, allowing plugins to keep updated about changes to
    the table. Furthermore, the table is now dynamically allocated at
    runtime, allowing an arbitrary number of classifiers to be loaded
    via the new 'classifier_table_num' configuration directive.
  + Pre-Tagging infrastructure adds two new primitives to tag network
    traffic: src_as and dst_as, the source and destination Autonomous
    System Number (ASN). In pmacctd they work against a Network Map
    ('networks_file' configuration directive). In nfacctd and sfacctd
    they work against both sFlow/NetFlow ASN fields and Network Maps.
    Many thanks to Aaron Glenn for his strong support.
  ! PostgreSQL plugin and pmpgplay no more make use of EXCLUSIVE LOCKS 
    whenever the sql_dont_try_update directive is activated. We assume
    there is no need for them in a INSERTs-only framework as integrity
    of data is still guaranteed by transactions. The patch has been
    contributed by Jamie Wilkinson, many thanks ! 
  ! Commandline switches and a configuration file should cohexist and
    the formers need to take precedence over the latter, if required.
    This is a rather standard (and definitely more flexible) approach;
    before this release they were mutual exclusive. Read UPGRADE notes
    at this propo. Thanks for the suggestion to Ivan A. Beveridge.
  ! Some glibc functions (noticeably syslog()) rely upon a rather non-
    standard "extern char *__progname" pointer. Now, its existence is
    properly checked at configuration time. On Linux, setproctitle()
    was causing plugin name/type to get cutted down in messages sent
    to the syslog facility. Thanks to Karl Latiss for his bug report.
  ! Solved a bug involving the load of IPv6 entries from Networks Maps.
    It was causing the count of such entries to be always zero.

0.10.0rc3 -- 01-03-2006
  + Aapplication layer (L7) classification capabilities of pmacctd have
    been improved: shared object (SO) classifiers have been introduced;
    they are loaded runtime through dlopen(). pmacct offers them support
    for contexts (informations gathered - by the same classifier - from
    previous packets either in the same uni-directional flow or in the
    reverse one), private memory areas and lower layer header pointers,
    resulting in extra flexibility. Some examples can be found at the
    webpage: http://www.ba.cnr.it/~paolo/pmacct/classification/ 
  + 'classifier_tentatives' configuration key has been added: it allows
    to customize the number of tentatives made in order to classify a
    flow. The default number is five, which has proven to be ok but for
    certain types of classification it might result restrictive.
  + 'pmacctd_conntrack_buffer_size' configuration key has been added: it
    (intuitively) defines the size for the connection tracking buffer.
  + Support for Token Ring (IEEE 802.5) interfaces has been introduced
    in pmacctd. Many thanks to Flavio Piccolo for his strong support. 
  + 'savefile_wait' (-W commandline) configuration key has been added: if 
    set to true causes pmacctd to not return but wait to be killed after
    being finished with the supplied savefile. Useful when pushing data
    from a tcpdump/ethereal tracefile into a memory table (ie. to build
    graphs).
  ! An erroneous replacement of dst with src in mask_elem() was causing
    queries like "pmacct -c dst_host -M|-N <IP address>" to return zero
    counters. Thanks to Ryan Sleevi for signalling the weird behaviour. 
  ! Management of the connection tracking buffer has been changed: now,
    a successful search frees the matched entry instead of moving it in
    a chain of stale entries, available for quick reuse.
  ! Error logging of SQL plugins has been somewhat improved: now, error
    messages returned by the SQL software are forwarded to sql_db_error() 
    This will definitely allow to exit from the obscure crypticism of
    some generic error strings.

0.10.0rc2 -- 14-02-2006
  + CONNECTION TRACKING modules has been introduced into pmacctd: they are
    C routines that hint IP address/port couples for upcoming data streams
    as signalled by one of the parties into the control channel whenever
    is not possible to go with a RE classificator. Conntrack modules for
    FTP, SIP and RTSP protocols are included.
  + 'pidfile' directive way of work has been improved: firstly, whenever 
    a collector shuts down nicely, it now removes its pidfile. Secondly,
    active plugins now create a pidfile too: it takes the following form:
    <pidfile>-<plugin type>.<plugin name>. Thanks to Ivan A. Beveridge
    for sharing his thoughts at this propo.
  ! Minor fixes to the classification engine: TCP packets with no payload
    are not considered useful classification tentatives; a new flow can
    inherit the class of his reverse flow whenever it's still reasonably
    valid.
  ! Solved a segmentation fault issue affecting the classificator engine,
    whenever the 'snaplen' directive was not specified. Thanks to Flavio
    Piccolo for signalling it.
  ! Fixed a bug in the PostgreSQL plugin: it appeared in 0.10.0rc1 and was
    uniquely related to the newly introduced negative UPDATE SQL query.  
  ! INTERNALS has been updated with few notes about the new classification
    and connection tracking features. 

0.10.0rc1 -- 24-01-2006
  + PACKET CLASSIFICATION capabilities have been introduced into pmacctd:
    the implemented approach is fully extensible: classification patterns
    are based on regular expressions (RE), human-readable, must be placed
    into a common directory and have a .pat file extension. Many patterns
    for widespread protocols are available at L7-filter project homepage. 
    To support this feature, a new 'classifiers' configuration directive
    has been added. It expects full path to a spool directory containing
    the patterns.
  + A new 'sql_aggressive_classification' directive has been added aswell:
    it allows to move unclassified packets even in the case they are no
    more cached by the SQL plugin. This aggressive policy works by firing
    negative UPDATE SQL queries that, whenever successful, are followed
    by positive ones charging the extra packets to their final class.
  ! Input and Output interface fields (Pre-Tagging) have been set to be  
    32 bits wide. While NetFlow is ok with 16 bits, some sFlow agents are
    used to bigger integer values in order to identify their interfaces.
    The fix is courtesy of Aaron Glenn. Thank you. 
  ! Flow filtering troubles have been noticed while handling MPLS-tagged
    flows inside NetFlow v9 datagrams. Thanks to Nitzan Tzelniker for his
    cooperation in solving the issue.
  ! A new exit_all() routine now handles nicely fatal errors detected by
    the Core Process, after plugins creation. It avoids leaving orphan
    plugins after the Core Process shutdown.

0.9.6 -- 27-Dec-2005
  + Support for 'sql_multi_values' has been introduced into the new SQLite
    3.x plugin. It allows to chain multiple INSERT queries into a single
    SQL statement. The idea is that inserting many rows at the same time
    is much faster than using separate single-row statements.
  ! MySQL plugin fix: AS numbers were sent to the database unquoted while 
    the corresponding field was declared as CHAR. By correctly wrapping AS
    numbers, a major performance increase (expecially when UPDATE queries
    are spawned) has been confirmed. Many thanks to Inge Bjørnvall Arnesen
    for discovering, signalling and solving the issue.
  ! MySQL plugin fix: multi-values INSERT queries have been optimized by
    pushing out of the queue purging loop the proper handling for the EOQ
    event.
  ! The introduction of the intermidiate SQL layer in the 0.9.5 version
    choked the dynamic SQL table creation capability. This has been fixed.
    Thanks to Vitalij Brajchuk for promptly signalling the issue. 
  ! The 'pidfile' configuration key has got incorrectly disabled in both 
    nfacctd and sfacctd. Thanks to Aaron Glenn for signalling the issue.
  ! The 'daemonize' (-D) configuration key was incorrectly disabling the
    signal handlers from the Core Process once backgrounded. As a result
    the daemon was not listening for incoming SIGINTs. Again, many thanks 
    go to Aaron Glenn.
 
0.9.5 -- 07-Dec-2005
  + PMACCT OPENS TO SQLITE 3.x: a fully featured SQLite, version 3.x only,
    plugin has been introduced; SQLite is a small C library that implements
    a self-contained, embeddable, zero-configuration SQL (almost all SQL92)
    database engine. The plugin is LOCK-based and supports the "recovery
    mode" via an alternate database action. Expecially suitable for tiny
    and embedded environments. The plugin can be fired using the keyword
    'sqlite3'. See CONFIG-KEYS and EXAMPLES for further informations. 
  + A new SQL layer - common to MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite plugins - has
    been introduced. It's largely callback-based and results in a major
    architectural change: it sits below the specific SQL code (facing the
    Core Process's abstraction layer) and will (hopefully) help in reducing
    potential bugs and will allow for a quick implementation of new SQL
    plugins.
  ! A bug concerning the setup of insert callback functions for summed (in
    + out) IPv6 traffic has been fixed. The issue was affecting all SQL
    plugins. 
  ! A bug concerning the handling of MPLS labels has been fixed in pmacctd.
    Many thanks to Gregoire Tourres and Frontier Online for their support.

0.9.4p1 -- 14-Nov-2005
  ! Minor bugfix in pretag.c: a wrongly placed memcpy() was preventing the
    code to be compiled by gcc 2.x . Many thanks to Kirill Ponomarew and
    Kris Kennaway for signalling the issue.
  ! Fixed an alignment issue revealed in the query_header structure; it has
    been noticed only under some circumstances: '--enable-64bit' enabled,
    64bit platform and gcc 3.x . Many thanks to Aaron Glenn for his strong
    support in solving the issue.

0.9.4 -- 08-Nov-2005
  + Hot map reload has been introduced. Maps now can be modified and then
    reloaded without having to stop the daemon. SIGUSR2 has been reserved for
    this use. The feature applies to Pre-Tagging map (pre_tag_map), Networks
    map (networks_file) and Ports map (ports_file). It is enabled by default
    and might be disabled via the new 'refresh_maps' configuration directive.
    Further details are in CONFIG-KEYS. 
  ! Some major issues have been solved in the processing of libpcap-format
    savefiles. Some output inconsistencies were caused by a corruption of the
    pcap file handler; bufferization is now enabled by default and the last
    buffer is correctly processed. Many thanks go to Amir Plivatsky for his
    strong support.  
  ! 'sql_table_schema' directive: in read_SQLquery_from_file() the strchr()
    has been replaced by strrchr() allowing to chain more SQL statements as
    part of the SQL table creation. This results useful, for example, to do
    CREATE INDEX after CREATE TABLE. The patch is courtesy of Dmitriy Nikulin. 
  ! SIGTERM signal is now handled properly to ensure a better compatibility
    of all pmacct daemons under the daemontools framework. The patch is
    courtesy of David C. Maple.
  ! Memory plugin: some issues caused by the mix of not compatible compilation
    parameters have been fixed. Now the pmacct client now correctly returns a
    warning message if: counters are of different size (32bit vs 64bit) or IP
    addresses are of different size (IPv4-only vs IPv6-enabled packages). 
  ! Print plugin, few bugfixes: the handling of the data ring shared with the
    Core Process was not optimal; it has been rewritten. P_exit() routine was
    not correctly clearing cached data. 

0.9.3 -- 11-Oct-2005
  + IPv4/IPv6 multicast support has been introduced in the NetFlow (nfacctd)
    and the sFlow (sfacctd) daemons. A maximum of 20 multicast groups may be
    joined by a single daemon instance. Groups can be defined by using the two
    sister configuration keys: nfacctd_mcast_groups and sfacctd_mcast_groups. 
  + sfacctd: a new 'sfacctd_renormalize' config key allows to automatically 
    renormalize byte/packet counters value basing on informations acquired
    from the sFlow datagram. In particular, it allows to deal with scenarios
    in which multiple interfaces have been configured at different sampling
    rates. It also calculates an effective sampling rate which could differ
    from the configured one - expecially at high rates - because of various
    losses. Such estimated rate is then used for renormalization purposes.
    Many thanks go to Arnaud De-Bermingham and Ovanet for the strong support
    offered during the development.
  + sfacctd: a new 'sampling_rate' keyword is supported into the Pre-Tagging 
    layer. It allows to tag aggregates - generated from sFlow datagrams - on
    a sampling rate basis. 
  + setproctitle() calls have been introduced (quite conservatively) and are
    actually supported on Linux and BSDs. The process title is rewritten in
    the aim of giving the user more informations about the running processes
    (that is, it's not intended to be just a cosmetic stuff).
  ! sql_preprocess tier was suffering a bug: actions (eg. usrf, adjb), even
    if defined, were totally ignored if no checks were defined aswell. Many
    thanks to Draschl Clemens for signalling the issue.
  ! Some minor bugs have been catched around sfacctd and fixed accordingly.
    Again, many thanks to Arnaud De-Bermingham.

0.9.2 -- 14-Sep-2005
  + A new 'usrf' keyword is now supported into the 'sql_preprocess' tier: it
    allows to apply a generic uniform renormalization factor to counters. Its
    use is particularly suitable for use in conjunction with uniform sampling
    methods (for example simple random - e.g. sFlow, 'sampling_rate' directive
    or simple systematic - e.g. sampled NetFlow by Cisco and Juniper). 
  + A new 'adjb' keyword is now supported into the 'sql_preprocess' tier: it
    allows to add (or subtract in case of negative value) 'adjb' bytes to the
    bytes counter. This comes useful when fixed lower (link, llc, etc.) layer 
    sizes need to be included into the bytes counter (as explained by the Q7
    in the updated FAQS document).
  + A new '--enable-64bit' configuration switch allows to compile the package
    with byte/packet/flow counters of 64bit (instead of the usual 32bit ones). 
  ! The sampling algorithm endorsed by the 'sampling_rate' feature has been 
    enhanced to a simple randomic one (it was a simple systematic). 
  ! Some static memory structures are now declared as constants allowing to
    save memory space (given the multi-process architecture) and offering an
    overral better efficiency. The patch is courtesy of Andreas Mohr. Thanks.
  ! Some noisy compiler warnings have been troubleshooted along with some minor
    code cleanups; the contribution is from Jamie Wilkinson. Thanks.
  ! Some unaligned pointer issues have been solved. 

0.9.1 -- 16-Aug-2005
  + Probabilistic, flow size dependent sampling has been introduced into the
    'sql_preprocess' tier via the new 'fss' keyword: it is computed against
    the bytes counter and returns renormalized results. Aggregates which have
    collected more than the 'fss' threshold in the last time window are
    sampled. Those under the threshold are sampled with probability p(bytes). 
    For further details read the CONFIG-KEYS and the paper:
    - N.G. Duffield, C. Lund, M. Thorup, "Charging from sampled network usage"
      http://www.research.att.com/~duffield/pubs/DLT01-usage.pdf
  + Probabilistic sampling under hard resource constraints has been introduced
    into the 'sql_preprocess' tier via the new 'fsrc' keyword: it is computed
    against the bytes counter and returns renormalized results. The method
    selects only 'fsrc' flows from the set of the flows collected during the
    last time window, providing an unbiasied estimate of the real bytes counter.
    For further details read the CONFIG-KEYS and the paper:
    - N.G. Duffield, C. Lund, M. Thorup, "Flow Sampling Under Hard Resource Constraints"
      http://www.research.att.com/~duffield/pubs/DLT03-constrained.pdf
  + A new 'networks_mask' configuration directive has been introduced: it
    allows to specify a network mask - in bits - to be applied apply to src_net
    and dst_net primitives. The mask is applied before evaluating the content of 
    'networks_file' (if any).
  + Added a new signal handler for SIGUSR1 in pmacctd: a 'killall -USR1 pmacctd'
    now returns a few statistics via either console or syslog; the syslog level
    reserved for such purpose is the NOTICE. 
  ! sfacctd: an issue regarding non-IP packets has been fixed: some of them
    (mainly ARPs) were incorrectly reported. Now they are properly filtered out. 
  ! A minor memory leak has been fixed; it was affecting running instances of
    pmacctd, nfacctd and sfacctd with multiple plugins attached. Now resources
    are properly recollected. 

0.9.0 -- 25-Jul-2005
  + PMACCT OPENS TO sFlow: support for the sFlow v2/v4/v5 protocol has been
    introduced and a new daemon 'sfacctd' has been added. The implementation
    includes support for BGP, MPLS, VLANs, IPv4, IPv6 along with packet tagging,
    filtering and aggregation capabilities. 'sfacctd' makes use of Flow Samples
    exported by a sFlow agent while Counter Samples are skipped and the MIB is
    ignored. All actually supported backends are available for storage: MySQL,
    PostgreSQL and In-Memory tables. http://www.sflow.org/products/network.php
    lists the network equipments supporting the sFlow protocol.
  + A new commandline option '-L' is now supported by 'nfacctd' and 'sfacctd';
    it allows to specify an IPv4/IPv6 address where to bind the daemon. It is
    the equivalent for the 'nfacctd_ip' and 'sfacctd_ip' configuration directives. 
  ! The NetFlow v9 MPLS stack handler has been fixed; it now also sticks the BoS
    bit (Bottom of the Stack) to the last processed label. This makes the flow
    compliant to BPF filters compiled by the newly released libpcap 0.9.3. 
  ! Some Tru64 compilation issues related to the ip_flow.[c|h] files have been
    solved. 
  ! Some configuration tests have been added; u_intXX_t definitions are tested
    and fixed (whenever possible, ie. uintXX_t types are available). Particularly
    useful on Solaris and IRIX platforms.
  ! Configuration hints for MySQL headers have been enhanced. This will ease the
    compilation of pmacct against MySQL library either from a precompiled binary
    distribution or from the FreeBSD ports. Many hhanks for the bug report go to
    John Von Essen. 
  ! NetFlow v8 source/destination AS handlers have been fixed. 

0.8.8 -- 27-Jun-2005
  + Added IP flows support in pmacctd (release 0.8.5 has seen its introduction
    in nfacctd) for both IPv4 and IPv6 handlers. To enable flows accounting,
    the 'aggregate' directive now supports a new 'flows' keyword. The SQL table
    v4 has to be used in order to support this feature in both SQL plugins.
  + A new 'sum_mac' aggregation method has been added (this is in addition to
    the already consolidated ones: 'sum_host', 'sum_net', 'sum_as', 'sum_port').
    Sum is intended to be the total traffic (inbound traffic summed to outbound
    one) produced by a specific MAC address.
  + Two new configuration directives have been introduced in order to set an 
    upper bound to the growth of the fragment (default: 4Mb) and flow (default:
    16Mb) buffers: 'pmacctd_frag_buffer_size', 'pmacctd_flows_buffer_size'.
  + A new configuration directive 'pmacctd_flow_lifetime' has been added and 
    defines how long a flow could remain inactive (ie. no packets belonging to
    such flow are received) before considering it expired (default: 60 secs).
    This is part of the pmacctd IP flows support.
  + Console/syslog feedbacks about either generic errors or malformed packets
    have been greatly enhanced. Along with the cause of the message, now any
    generated message contains either the plugin name/type or the configuration
    file that is causing it. 
  ! nfacctd: when IPv6 is enabled (on non-BSD systems) the daemon now listens
    by default on a IPv6 socket getting rid of the v4-in-v6 mapping feature which
    helps in receiving NetFlow datagrams from both IPv4 and IPv6 agents. A new
    configure script switch --enable-v4-mapped is aimed to turn manually on/off
    the feature.
  ! Fixed an issue with the SIGCHLD handling routine on FreeBSD 4.x systems. It
    was causing the sudden creation of zombie processes because of the not correct
    retirement of exited childs. Many thanks for his bug report and strong support
    go to John Von Essen.
  ! Fixed an endianess issue regarding Solaris/x86 platforms caused by not proper
    preprocessor tests. Many thanks to Imre Csatlos for his bug report. 
  ! Fixed the default schema for the PostgreSQL table v4. The 'flows' field was
    lacking of the 'DEFAULT 0' modifier; it was causing some troubles expecially
    when such tables were used in conjunction with the 'sql_optimize_clauses'
    directive. Many thanks for his bug report and strong support go to Anik Rahman. 

0.8.7 -- 14-Jun-2005
  + pmacctd: MPLS support has been introduced. MPLS (on ethernet and ppp links)
    and MPLS-over-VLAN (ethernet only) packets are now supported and passed to
    upper layer routines. Filtering and tagging (Pre-Tagging) packets basing on
    MPLS labels is also supported. Recent libpcap is required (ie, CVS versions
    >= 06-06-2005 are highly adviceable because of the support for MPLS label
    hierarchies like "mpls 100000 and mpls 1024" that will match packets with 
    an outer label of 100000 and an inner label of 1024).  
  + nfacctd: VLAN and MAC addresses support for NetFlow v9 has been introduced.
    Each of them is mapped to its respective primitive (vlan, src_mac, dst_mac);
    filtering and tagging (Pre-Tagging) IPv4/IPv6 flows basing on them is also
    supported.
  + nfacctd: filtering and tagging (Pre-Tagging) IPv4/IPv6 flows basing on MPLS
    labels has been introduced (read the above notes regarding libpcap version
    requirements).
  + A new packet capturing size option has been added to pmacctd ('snaplen'
    configuration directive; '-L' commandline). It allows to change the default
    portion of the packet captured by the daemon. It results useful to cope 
    with not fixed protocol stacks (ie, the MPLS stack).
  + pmacctd: CHDLC support has been introduced. IPv4, IPv6 and MPLS packets are
    supported on this link layer protocol.
  ! Cleanups have been added to the NetFlow packet processing cycle. They are
    mainly aimed to ensure that no stale data is read from circular buffers 
    when processing NetFlow v8/v9 packets. 
  ! The NetFlow v9 VLAN handling routine was missing a ntohs() call, resulting
    in an ncorrect VLAN id on little endian architectures.  
  ! ether_aton()/ether_ntoa() routines were generating segmentation faults on
    x86_64 architectures. They have been replaced by a new handmade couple:
    etheraddr_string()/string_etheraddr(). Many thanks to Daniel Streicher for
    the bug report.  

0.8.6 -- 23-May-2005
  + The support for dynamic SQL tables has been introduced through the use of
    the following variables in the 'sql_table' directive: %d (the day of the
    month), %H (hours using an 24 hours clock), %m (month number), %M (minutes),
    %w (the day of the week as a decimal number), %W (week number in the current
    year) and %Y (the current year). This enables, for example, substitutions
    like the following ones:
      'acct_v4_%Y%m%d_%H%M'	==> 	'acct_v4_20050519_1500'
      'acct_v4_%w'		==> 	'acct_v4_05'
  + A new 'sql_table_schema' configuration directive has been added in order
    to allow the automatic creation of dynamic tables. It expects as value the
    full pathname to a file containing the schema to be used for table creation.
    An  example of the schema follows:
      CREATE TABLE acct_v4_%Y%m%d_%H%M (
        ... PostgreSQL/MySQL specific schema ...
      );
  + Support for MySQL multi-values INSERT clauses has been added. Inserting
    many rows in a single shot has proven to be much faster (many times faster
    in some cases) than using separate single INSERT statements. A new
    'sql_multi_values' configuration directive has been added to enable this
    feature. Its value is intended to be the size (in bytes) of the multi-values
    buffer. Out of the box, MySQL >= 4.0.x supports values up to 1024000 (1Mb).
    Because it does not require any changes on server side, people using MySQL
    are strongly encouraged to give it a try.
  + A new '--disable-l2' configure option has been added. It is aimed to compile 
    pmacct without support for Layer-2 stuff: MAC addresses and VLANs. This
    option - along with some more optimizations to memory structures done in this
    same release - have produced memory savings up to 25% compared to previous
    versions. 
  ! Recovery code for PostgreSQL plugin has been slightly revised and fixed.

0.8.5 -- 04-May-2005
  + Added IP flows counter support in nfacctd, the NetFlow accounting daemon,
    in addition to the packets and bytes ones. To enable flows accounting, the
    'aggregate' directive now supports a new 'flows' keyword. A new SQL table
    version, v4, has been also introduced to support this feature in both SQL
    plugins. 
  + 'sql_preprocess' directive have been strongly improved by the addition of
    new keywords to handle thresholds. This preprocessing feature is aimed to 
    process aggregates (via a comma-separated list of conditionals and checks)
    before they are pulled to the DB, thus resulting in a powerful selection
    tier; whether the check is meet, the aggregate goes on its way to the DB;
    the new thresholds are: maxp (maximum number of packets), maxb (maximum bytes
    transferred), minf/maxf (minimum/maximum number of flows), minbpp/maxbbp
    (minimum/maximum bytes per packet average value), minppf/maxppf (minimum/
    maximum packets per flow average value). 
  + Added a new 'sql_preprocess_type' directive; the values allowed are 'any'
    or 'all', with 'any' as default value. It is intended to be the connective
    whether 'sql_preprocess' contains multiple checks. 'any' requires that an
    aggregate has to match just one of the checks in order to be valid; 'all'
    requires a match against all of the checks instead.
  + Added the ability to instruct a BPF filter against the ToS field of a NetFlow
    packet.  
  ! Minor optimizations on the 'sql_preprocess' handler chain.

0.8.4 -- 14-Apr-2005
  + Added support for NetFlow v7/v8. The Version 7 (v7) format is exclusively
    supported by Cisco Catalyst series switches equipped with a NetFlow feature
    card (NFFC). v7 is not compatible with Cisco routers. The Version 8 (v8)
    format adds (with respect to older v5/v7 versions) router-based aggregation
    schemes.
  + Added the chance to tag packets basing on NetFlow v8 aggregation type field. 
    As the keyword suggests, it will work successfully just when processing  
    NetFlow v8 packets. Useful to split - backend side - data per aggregation
    type. 
  + pmacct client now is able to ask for the '0' (that is, untagged packets) tag
    value. Moreover, all 'sum' aggregations (sum_host, sum_net, sum_as, sum_port)
    can now be associated with both Pre/Post-Tagging.  
  ! Fixed a serious memory leak located in the routines for handling NetFlow v9
    templates. While the bug was needing certain conditions to manifest, anyone
    using NetFlow v9 is strongly encouraged to upgrade to this version. All
    previous versions were affected.
  ! Some gcc4 compliance issues have been solved. The source code is known to
    work fine on amd64 architectures. Thanks very much to Marcelo Goes for his
    patch.
  ! Engine Type/Engine ID fields were not correctly evaluated when using NetFlow
    v5 and Pre-Tagging. The issue has been fixed.
  ! Long comments in the Ports Definition File were causing some incorrect error
    messages. However it seems the file were processed correctly. Thanks to Bruno
    Mattarollo for signalling the issue.
  ! Minor fix to plugins hooking code. The reception of sparse SIGCHLD signals 
    were causing the poll() to return. The impact was null. The issue has been
    fixed by ignoring such signals. 

0.8.3 -- 29-Mar-2005
  + Pre-Tagging capabilities have been further enhanced: captured traffic can
    be now marked basing on the NetFlow nexthop/BGP nexthop fields. While the
    old NetFlow versions (v1, v5) carry an unique 'nexthop' field, NetFlow v9
    supports them into two distinguished fields. 
  + Packet/flows tagging is now explicit, gaining more flexibility: a new 'tag'
    keyword has been added to the 'aggregate' directive. It causes the traffic
    to be actually marked; the 'pre_tag_map' and 'post_tag' directives now just
    evaluate the tag to be assigned. Read further details about this topic in
    the UPGRADE document.
  + The 'pre_tag_filter' directive now accepts 0 (zero) as valid value: we have 
    to remember that zero is not a valid tag; hence, its support allows to split
    or filter untagged traffic from tagged one. 
  + Documentation has been expanded: a new FAQS entry now describes few and easy
    tweaks needed to replace the bytes counter type from u_int32_t to u_int64_t
    throughout the code (provided that the OS supports this type); it's useful
    in conjunction with the In-Memory plugin while exposed to very sustained
    traffic loads. A new FAQS entry describes the first efforts aimed to integrate
    pmacctd with popular flow-tools software by the way of the flow-export tool.
    A new UPGRADE document has been also created. 
  ! pmacct client was handling counters returned by the '-N' switch as signed
    integers, which is not correct. The issue has been fixed. Many thanks to
    Tobias Bengtsson for signalling it. 
  ! Two new routines file_lock()/file_unlock() have replaced the flock() calls
    because they were preventing the pmacct code to compile on Solaris. Basing
    over hints collected at configure time, the routines enable either the flock()
    or fcntl() code. Many thanks to Jan Baumann for signalling and solving the
    issue. 


0.8.2 -- 08-Mar-2005
  + Pre-Tagging capabilities have been enhanced: now, a Pre Tag Map allows to
    mark either packets or flows basing on the outcome of a BPF filter. Because
    of this new feature, Pre-tagging has been introduced in 'pmacctd' too.
    Pre-tagging was already allowing 'nfacctd' to translate some NetFlow packet
    fields (exporting agent IP address, Input/Output interface, Engine type and
    Engine ID) into an ID (also referred as 'tag'), a small number in the range
    1-65535. 
  + A new 'pmacctd_force_frag_handling' configuration directive has been added;
    it aims to support 'pmacctd' Pre-Tagging operations: whether the BPF filter
    requires tag assignation based on transport layer primitives (e.g. src port
    or dst port), this directive ensures the right tag is stamped to fragmented
    traffic too. 
  + Pre Tag filtering (which can be enabled via 'pre_tag_filter' configuration
    directive) allows to filter aggregates basing on the previously evaluated 
    ID: whether it matches with at least one of the filter values, the aggregate
    is delivered to the plugin. It has been enhanced by allowing to assign more 
    tags to a specific plugin. 
  + pmacctd: a new feature to read libpcap savefiles has been added; it can be
    enabled either via the 'pcap_savefile' configuration directive or the '-I'
    commandline switch. Files need to be already closed and correctly finalized
    in order to be read successfully. Many thanks to Rafael Portillo for proposing
    the idea.
  + pmacct client tool supports a new 'tag' keyword as value for the '-c' switch:
    it allows to query the daemon requesting a match against aggregate tags.  
  + pmacct client: the behaviour of the '-N' switch (which makes the client to
    return a counter onto the screen suitable for data injection in tools like MRTG,
    Cacti, RRDtool, etc.), has been enhanced: it was already allowing to ask data
    from the daemon but basing only on exact matches. This concept has now extended,
    adding both wildcarding of specific fields and partial matches. Furthermore,
    when multiple requests are encapsulated into a single query, their results are
    by default splitted (that is, each request has its result); a newly introduced
    '-S' switch now allows to sum multiple results into a single counter.
  ! Bugfix: proper checks for the existence of a 'pre_tag_map' file were bypassed
    under certain conditions; however, this erroneous behaviour was not causing any
    serious issue. The correct behaviour is to quit and report the problem to the
    user. 
  ! The sampling rate algorithm has been fixed from a minor issue: it was returning
    not expected results when 'sampling_rate: 1'. It now works as expected. Thanks
    to David C. Maple for his extensive support in gaining a better understanding
    of the problem. 

0.8.1p1 -- 22-Feb-2005
  ! 'sum_host' and 'sum_net' compound primitives have been fixed in order to
    work with IPv6 addresses.
  ! In-Memory Plugin: client queries spotted with both '-r' (reset counters) and
    '-N' (exact match, print counters only) switches enabled were causing the
    daemon to crash whether no entries were found. The problem has been fixed.
    Many thanks to Zach Chambers for signalling the issue.
  ! In-Memory Plugin: client queries spotted with either '-M' or '-N' switches
    enabled were failing to match actual data when either 'sum_host', 'sum_net' 
    or 'sum_as' primitives were in use. The issue has been fixed. 
  ! The modulo function applied to NetFlow v9 Template Cache has been enhanced
    in order to deal correctly with export agents having an IPv6 address. 
  ! Networks/AS definition file: a new check has been added in order to verify 
    whether network prefix/network mask pairs are compatible: if they are not,
    the mask is applied to the prefix. 
  ! Documentation has been expanded and revised.

0.8.1 -- 25-Jan-2005
  + Accounting and aggregation over DSCP, IPv4 ToS field and IPv6 traffic class
    field have been introduced ('aggregate' directive, 'tos' value): these fields
    are actually widely used to implement Layer-3 QoS policies by defining new
    classes of service (most noticeably 'Less than Best Effort' and 'Premium IP').
    MySQL and PostgreSQL tables v3 (third version) have been introduced (they
    contain an additional 4-bytes 'tos' field) to support the new Layer-3 QoS
    accounting.
  + nfacctd core process has been slightly optimized: each flow is encapsulated
    (thus, copied field-by-field) into a BPF-suitable structure only if one or
    more plugins actually require BPF filtering ('aggregate_filter' directive).
    Otherwise, if either filtering is not required or all requested filters fail
    to compile, the copy is skipped. 
  + 'pmacct', pmacct client tool: '-e' commandline option (which meaning is:
    full memory table erase) now might be supplied in conjunction with other
    options (thus avoiding the short time delays involved by two consecutive
    queries, ask-then-erase, which may also lead to small losses).
    The new implemented mechanism works as follow: queries over actual data
    (if any) are served before; the table is locked, new aggregates are queued
    until the erasure finishes (it may take seconds if the table is large enough);
    the table is unlocked; the queue of aggregates is processed and all normal
    operations are resumed. Many thanks to Piotr Gackiewicz for the valuable
    exchange of ideas.
  ! Bug fixed in nfacctd: source and destination AS numbers were incorrectly
    read from NetFlow packets. Thanks to Piotr Gackiewicz for his support. 
  ! Bug fixed in pmacct client: while retrieving the whole table content was
    displaying espected data, asking just for 'dst_as' field was resulting in
    no results instead. Thanks, once more, to Piotr Gackiewicz. 


0.8.0 -- 12-Jan-2005
  + PMACCT OPENS TO IPv6: IPv6 support has been introduced in both 'pmacctd' 
    and 'nfacctd' daemons. Because it requires larger memory structures to
    store its addresses, IPv6 support has been disabled by default. It could
    be enabled at configure time via '--enable-ipv6' switch. All filtering,
    tagging and mapping functions already support IPv6 addresses. Some notes 
    about IPv6 and SQL table schema have been dropped into README.IPv6 file,
    sql section of the tarball. 
  + PMACCT OPENS TO NetFlow v9: support for the template-based Cisco NetFlow
    v9 export protocol has been added. NetFlow v1/v5 were already supported.
    'nfacctd' may now be bound to an IPv6 interface and is able to read both
    IPv4 and IPv6 data flowsets. A single 'nfacctd' instance may read flows
    of different versions and coming from multiple exporting agents. Source
    and destination MAC addresses and VLAN tags are supported in addition to
    the primitives already supported in v1/v5 (source/destination IP addresses,
    AS, ports and IP protocol). Templates are cached and refreshed as soon as
    they are resent by the exporting agent.  
  + Pre Tag map ('pre_tag_map' configuration key), which allows to assign a
    small integer (ID) to an incoming flow basing on NetFlow auxiliar data,
    now may apply tags basing also over Engine Type (it provides uniqueness
    with respect to the routing engine on the exporting device) and Engine
    ID (it provides uniqueness with respect to the particular line card or
    VIP on the exporting device) fields. Incoming and Outcoming interfaces
    were already supported. See 'pretag.map.example' into tarball examples
    section and CONFIG-KEYS document for further details. 
  + Raw protocol (DLT_RAW) routine has been added; it usually allows to read
    data from tunnels and sitX devices (used for IPv6-in-IPv4 encapsulation).
  + Some tests for architecture endianess, CPU type and MMU unaligned memory
    access capability have been added. A small and rough (yes, they work the
    hard way) set of unaligned copy functions have been added. They are aimed
    to be introduced through the code, however first tests over MIPS R10000
    and Alpha EV67 (21264A) have shown positive results.  
  ! PPPoE and VLAN layer handling routines have been slightly revised for some
    additional checks. 
  ! Given the fairly good portability reported from the mmap() code introduced
    through the whole 0.7.x development stage, the use of shared memory segments
    is now enabled by default. The configure switch '--enable-mmap' has been
    replaced by '--disable-mmap'. 
  ! 'pmacct' client tool: because of the IPv6 addresses introduction, separator 
    character for multiple queries (commandline) have been changed to from
    ':' to ';'. 
  ! 'nfacctd': '-F' commandline switch was listed into available options list,
    but getopt() stanza was missing, thus returning an invalid option message.
    Thanks to Chris Koutras for his support in fixing the issue.
  ! Some variable assignations were causing lvalue errors with gcc 4.0. Thanks
    to Andreas Jochens for his support in signalling and solving the problem. 

0.7.9 -- 21-Dec-2004
  + A new data pre-processor has been introduced in both SQL plugins: it
    allows to filter out data (via conditionals, checks and actions) during
    a cache-to-DB purging event, before building SQL queries; this way, for
    example, aggregates which have accounted just a few packets or bytes may
    be either discarded or saved through the recovery mechanism (if enabled).
    The small set of preprocessing directives is reported into CONFIG-KEYS
    document. 
  + Some new environment variables are now available when firing a trigger
    from SQL plugins: $EFFECTIVE_ELEM_NUMBER reports the effective number
    of aggregates (that is, excluding those filtered out at preprocessing
    time) encapsulated in SQL queries; $TOTAL_ELEM_NUMBER reports the total
    number of aggregates instead.
    $INSERT_QUERIES_NUMBER and $UPDATE_QUERIES_NUMBER returns respectively
    the number of aggregates being successfully encapsulated into INSERT
    and UPDATE queries. $ELAPSED_TIME reports the time took to complete
    the last purging event. For further details and the list of supported
    environment variables take a look to TRIGGER_VARS document.
  + Some additions to both logfile players: a new '-n' switch allows to play
    N elements; this way, arbitrary portions of the file may be played using
    '-n' in conjunction with the (already existing) '-o' switch which allows
    to read the logfile starting at a specified offset. New switches '-H',
    '-D', '-T', '-U', '-P' have been introduced to override SQL parameters
    like hostname, DB, table, user and password. The '-t -d' combination
    (test only, debug) now allows to print over the screen the content of
    the logfile.
  + Logfiles size is now limited to a maximum of 2Gb, thus avoiding issues
    connected to the 32bit declaration of off_t. While many OS implment a
    solution to the problem, seems there are few chances to solve it in a
    portable way. When the maximum size is hit the old logfile is rotated
    appending to its filename a trailing small integer ( in a way similar
    to logrotate) and a fresh one is started.
  ! Logfile players: '-s' switch, which was allowing to play one element
    a time, has been superseded. Its current equivalent is: '-n 1'. 
  ! The file opening algorithm has been slightly changed in SQL plugins:
    flock() follows shortly the fopen() and all subsequent operations and
    evaluations are thus strictly serialized. freopen() is avoided. 

0.7.8 -- 02-Dec-2004
  + Recovery logfile structure has been enhanced. Following the logfile
    header has been created a new template structure. Templates will avoid 
    the issue of being not able to read old logfiles because of changes to
    internal data structures. Templates are made of an header and a number
    of entries, each describing a single field of the following data.
    Both players, pmmyplay and pmpgplay, are able to parse logfiles basing
    over the template description. Backward logfile compatibility is broken.
  + Execcutable triggering mechanism (from SQL plugins) has been enhanced:
    some status informations (eg. stats of the last purging event) are now
    passed to the trigged executable in the form of environment variables.
    The list of supported variables has been summarized into TRIGGER_VARS
    document. The mechanism allows to spawn executables for post-processsing
    operations at arbitrary timeframes.
  + Support for 'temporary' devices (like PPP and maybe PCMCIA cards too)
    has been introduced. A new configuration directive 'interface_wait' (or
    '-w' commandline) instructs pmacctd to wait for the listening device to 
    become available. It works both when in startup phase and when already
    into main loop. A big thanks to Andre Berger for his support.
  ! ppp_handler() routine, which is in charge to handle PPP packets, have
    been totally rewritten. Thanks, again, to Andre Berger for his support.
  ! All link layer handling routines have been revised; some extra checks
    have been added to overcome issues caused from malicious handcrafted
    packets. 
  ! Some time handling and timeout issues have been revised into PostgreSQL
    plugin code. They were affecting only the triggering mechanism. 
  ! Fixed an execv() bug into MY_Exec() and PG_Exec(). It was causing the
    not correct execution of triggers. Now, a zeroed argv parameter is
    passed to the function. The problem has been verified on FreeBSD. 

0.7.7 -- 16-Nov-2004
  + Added two new aggregation primitives: 'src_as' and 'dst_as'. They allow
    accounting based over Autonomous System number; 'pmacctd' requires AS
    numbers to be supplied into a 'networks_file' configuration directive
    (which allows to specify the path to a networks definition file);
    'nfacctd' may either look up AS numbers from the networks definition file
    or read them from each NetFlow flow (this is default). 'nfacctd_as_new'
    key could be used to switch 'nfacctd' behaviour.
  + Added some new aggregation modes: 'sum_net', 'sum_as', 'sum_port' ('sum'
    which is actually an alias for 'sum_host' has been already introduced
    early). Sum is intended to be the total traffic (that is, inbound plus
    outbound traffic amounts) for each entry.
  + Added another aggregation primitive: 'none'. It does not make use of any
    primitive: it allows to see total bytes and packets transferred through
    an interface. 
  + The definition of a 'networks_file' enables network lookup: hosts inside
    defined networks are ok; hosts outside them are 'zeroed'. This behaviour
    may now also be applied to 'src_host', 'dst_host' and 'sum_host'. Under
    certain conditions (eg. when using only host/net/as primitives and defined 
    networks comprise all transiting hosts) it may be seen an alternative
    way to filter data. 
  ! 'frontend'/'backend' PostgreSQL plugin operations have been obsoleted.
    'unified'/'typed' operations have been introduced instead. See 'sql_data'
    description, CONFIG-KEYS document, for further informations.
  ! Optimizations have been applied to: core process, the newly introduced
    cache code (see 0.7.6) and in-memory table plugin. 
  ! Fixed some string handling routines: trim_all_spaces(), mark_columns()
  ! Solved a potential race condition which was affecting write_pid_file() 

0.7.6 -- 27-Oct-2004
  + Many changes has been introduced on 'pmacct' client side. '-m' switch
    (which output was suitable as MRTG input) has been obsoleted (though it
    will continue to work for next few releases). A new '-N' switch has
    been added: it returns counter value, suitable for integration with
    either RRDtool or MRTG. 
  + Support for batch queries have also been added into pmacct client. It
    allows to join up to 4096 requests into a single query. Requests could
    either be concatenated commandline or read from a file (more details are
    in FAQS and EXAMPLES). Batch queries allow to handle efficiently high number
    of requests in a single shot (for example to timely feed data to a large
    amount of graphs). 
  + Still pmacct client: '-r' switch, which already allows to reset counters
    for matched entries, now it also applies to group of matches (also referred
    as partial matches). 
  + New scripts have been added into the examples tree which show how to
    integrate memory and SQL plugins with RRDtool, MRTG and GNUplot. 
  + Memory plugin (IMT) has been further enhanced; each query from pmacct
    client is now evaluated and if involves just a short ride through the
    memory structure, it is served by the plugin itself without spawning a
    new child process. Batch queries support and reordering of fragmented
    queries have also been added.  
  + New cache has been introduced in both SQL plugins; its layout is still
    an hash structure but it now features also chains, allocation, reuse and
    retirement of chained nodes. It also sports a LRU list of nodes which eases
    node handling. The new solution avoids the creation of a collision queue,
    ensuring uniqueness of data placed onto the queries queue. While this
    already greatly benefits a directive like 'sql_dont_try_update', it also
    opens new chances for post-processing operations of queries queue. 

0.7.5 -- 14-Oct-2004
  + Introduced support for the definition of a 'known ports' list, when
    either 'src_port' or 'dst_port' primitives are in use. Known ports
    will get written into the backend; unknown ports will be simply zeroed.
    It could be enabled via 'ports_file' configuration key or '-o' commandline
    switch.
  + Introduced support for weekly and monthly counters breakdown; hourly, 
    minutely and daily were already supported. New breakdowns could be
    enabled via 'w' and 'M' words in 'sql_history' and related configuration
    keys.  
  + Added a '-i' commandline switch to both 'pmmyplay' and 'pmpgplay' to
    avoid UPDATE SQL queries and skip directly to INSERT ones. Many thanks 
    to Jamie Wilkinson. 
  ! 'pmmyplay' and 'pmpgplay' code has been optimized and updated; some 
    pieces of locking and transactional code were included into the inner
    loop. A big thanks goes to Wim Kerkhoff and Jamie Wilkinson.
  ! Networks aggregation code has been revised and optimized; a direct-mapped
    cache has been introduced to store (and search) last search results
    from the networks table. A binary search algorithm, though optimized,
    over the table has still been preferred over alternative approaches
    (hash, tries).

0.7.4 -- 30-Sep-2004
  + Enhanced packet tagging support; it's now broken in Pre-Tagging and
    Post-Tagging; Pre-Tagging allows 'nfacctd' to assign an ID to a flow
    evaluating an arbitrary combination of supported NetFlow packet
    fields (actually: IP address, Input Interface, Output Interface); the
    Pre-Tagging map is global; Pre-Tag is applied as soon as each flow
    is processed; Post-Tagging allows both 'nfacctd' and 'pmacctd' to
    assign an ID to packets using a supplied value; Post-Tagging could be
    either global or local to a single plugin (and more plugins may tag
    differently); Post-Tag is applied as a last action before the packet
    is sent to the plugin. 'nfacctd_id_map' and 'pmacctd_id' configuration
    keys are now obsolete; 'pre_tag_map' and 'post_tag' are introduced to
    replace them. 
  + Added support for Pre-Tag filtering; it allows to filter packets basing
    on their Pre-Tag value. The filter is evaluated after Pre-Tagging but
    before Post-Tagging; it adds to BPF filtering support ('aggregate_filter'
    configuration key); 'pre_tag_filter' configuration key is introduced.
  + Added support for Packet Sampling; the current implementation bases on
    a simple systematic algorithm; the new 'sampling_rate' configuration
    key expects a positive integer value >= 1 which is the ratio of the
    packets to be sampled (translates in: pick only 1 out of N packets).
    The key is either global or local (meaning that each plugin could apply
    different sampling rates).
  ! Fixed a bug which was causing crashes in both 'pmacctd' and 'nfacctd'
    when '-r' parameter was specified commandline. Thanks to Ali Nikham 
    for his support. 

0.7.3 -- 31-Aug-2004
  + Added support for both Netflow 'input interface' and 'output interface'
    fields. These two fields are contained in each flow record inside a
    NetFlow packet. It works through ID mapping (read below).
  + The ID map file syntax has been enhanced to allow greater flexibility
    in ID assignation to packets; example: 'id=1 ip=192.168.1.1 in=3
    out=5'; the above line will cause the 'ID' 1 to be assigned to
    flows exported by a NetFlow agent (for example a router) which IP
    address is '192.168.1.1' and transiting from interface '3' to interface
    '5'. 
  + In-memory table operations have been enhanced when using shared memory;
    a new reset flag has been added to avoid race conditions.
  ! Configuration lines are no more limited to some fixed maximum length
    but are allocated dynamically; this to overcome the need for long
    configuration lines to declare arbitrary filters and plugin's list.
    Thanks to Jerry Ji for his support.
  ! Configuration handlers, which are responsible to parse and validate
    values for each configuration key, have been rewritten on the way
    for a better portability. 
  ! Signal handler routines have been changed to better accomodate SysV
    semantics. 
  ! Fixed shared memory mmap() operations on IRIX and SunOS; a further
    test checks for either 'MAP_ANON' or 'MAP_ANONYMOUS' definitions; in
    case of negative outcome, mmap() will use '/dev/zero'. 
  ! Packet handlers have been revised and optimized.
  ! Some optimizations have been added when using shared memory; write()
    function has been usually called to signal the arrival of each new packet,
    through the core process/plugin control channel; now it does so if and
    only if the plugin, on the other side, is actually blocking over a poll();
    because of sequence numbers guarantee, data is directly written into
    shared memory segment.

0.7.2p1 -- 08-Aug-2004
  ! Multiple fixes in plugin's configuration post checks; negative outcome
    of some checks was leading to clear misbehaviours. Versions affected
    are >= 0.7.0 . A big thanks goes to Alexandra Walford for her support.

0.7.2 -- 02-Aug-2004
  + VLAN accounting has been added. The new 'vlan' keyword is supported as
    argument of both '-c' commandline switch and 'aggregate' configuration
    key.
  + Distributed accounting support has been added. It could be enabled into
    'pmacctd' via 'pmacctd_id' configuration key and into 'nfacctd' via the
    'nfacctd_id_file' configuration key. While 'pmacctd_id' key expects as
    value a small integer, 'nfacctd_id_file' expects a path to a file which
    contains the mapping: 'IP address of the router (exporting Newflow) ->
    small integer'. This scheme ease tasks such as keeping track of who has
    generated what data and either cluster or keep disjoint data coming from
    different sources when using a SQL database as backend. 
  + Introduced SQL table version 2. The SQL schema is the same as existing
    tables with the following additions: support for distributed accounting;
    support for VLAN accounting.
  + Added MAC addresses query capabilties to pmacct client. 
  + Added '-r' commandline switch to pmacct client. It can only be used in
    conjunction with '-m' or '-M' switches. It allows to reset packet and
    bytes counters of the retrieved record.
  ! Exit codes have been fixed in both 'pmacctd' and 'nfacctd'. Thanks to
    Jerry Ji for his signallation. 
  ! Fixed a problem when retrieving data from memory table: sometimes null
    data (without any error message) was returned to the client; the problem
    has been successfully reproduced only on FreeBSD 5.1: after an accept()
    call, the socket being returned inherits same flags of the listening
    socket, this case non-blocking flag. Thanks to Nicolas Deffayet for his
    support. 
  ! Revised PostgreSQL creation script. 

0.7.1 -- 14-Jul-2004
  + Added shared memory implementation; core process, now, could push data
    into a shared memory segment and then signal arrival of new data to the
    plugin. Shared memory support could be enabled via '--enable-mmap' switch
    at configuration time.
  + Strongly enhanced gathering capabilities of pmacct client; pmacct client
    is used to fetch data from memory plugin; it is, now, able to ask exact
    or partial matches via '-M' switch and return a readable listing output.
    MRTG export capabilities, full table fetch and table status query are
    still supported. 
  + Introduced SQL table versioning. It could be enabled via 'sql_table_version'
    configuration switch. It will enable to build new SQL tables (for example
    adding new aggregation methods) while allowing who is not interested in new
    setups to work with old tables. 
  + Added checks for packet capture type; informations acquired are later used
    for better handling pcap interface. 
  ! Fixed some issues concerning pmacctd VLAN and PPPOE code.
  ! Fixed a mmap() issue on Tru64 systems.
  ! Fixed some minor poll() misbehaviours in MySQL, PgSQL and print plugins;
    they were not correctly handled. 
  

0.7.0p1 -- 13-Jul-2004
  ! Fixes in cache code; affects MySQL, PgSQL and print plugins.

0.7.0 -- 01-Jul-2004
  + PMACCT OPENS TO NETFLOW: a new network daemon, nfacctd, is introduced:
    nfacctd listens for Netflow V1/V5 packets; is able to apply BPF filters
    and to aggregate packets; it's then able to either save data in a memory
    table, MySQL or PostgreSQL database or simply output packets on the screen.
    It can read timestamps from Netflow packets in msecs, seconds or ignore
    them generating new timestamps; a simple allow table mechanism allows
    to silently discard Netflow packets not generated by a list of trusted
    hosts.  
  + Strongly enhanced IP fragmentation handling in pmacctd.
  + Added new checks into the building systems; new hints when it searches 
    for libraries and headers; initial tests for C compilers capabilities
    have been added. 
  + Works to let pmacct run on IRIX platforms continue; some issues with
    MipsPRO compiler have been solved; added proper compilation flags/hints.
    SIGCHLD is now properly handled and child processes are correctly retired.
    (a thank for his support goes to Joerg Behrens) 
  + First, timidous, introduction of mmap() calls in memory plugin; they need
    to be enabled with '--enable-mmap' flag at configure time. 
  ! Fixed a potential deadlock issue in PostgreSQL plugin; changed locking
    mechanism. (a big thank to Wim Kerkhoff)
  ! Fixed an issue concerning networks aggregation on Tru64 systems.

0.6.4p1 -- 01-Jun-2004
  ! Fixed an issue with cache aliasing in MySQL and PostgreSQL plugins.
    Other plugins are not affected; this potential issue affects only
    version 0.6.4, not previous ones. Anyone using these plugins with 
    0.6.4 is strongly encouraged to upgrade to 0.6.4p1. 

0.6.4 -- 27-May-2004
  + Added chance to launch executables from both SQL plugins at arbitrary 
    time intervals to ease data post-processing tasks. Two new keys are
    available: 'sql_trigger_exec' and 'sql_trigger_time'. If any interval
    is supplied the specified executable is triggered every time data is
    purged from the cache. 
  + Added a new 'print' plugin. Enabling it, data is pulled at regular
    intervals to stdout in a way similar to cflowd's 'flow-print'.
    tool. New config keys are 'print_refresh_time', 'print_cache_entries'
    and 'print_markers'. This last key enables the print of start/end
    markers each time the cache is purged.  
  + Added 'sql_dont_try_update' switch to avoid UPDATE queries to the DB
    and skip directly to INSERT ones. Performance gains has been noticed
    when UPDATEs are not necessary (eg. when using timeslots to break up
    counters and sql_history = sql_refresh_time).
    Thanks to Jamie Wilkinson. 
  + Optimized use of transactions in PostgreSQL plugin; in the new scheme
    is built a single big transaction for each cache purge process. This
    leads to good performance gains; recovery mechanisms have been modified 
    to overcome whole transaction trashing. Many thanks to James Gregory
    and Jamie Wilkinson.
  ! Enhanced debug messages output when specific error conditions are returned
    by the DB. 
  ! Fixed a potential counters overflow issue in both MySQL and PgSQL
    plugins cache.
  ! Fixed preprocessor definitions issue: LOCK_UN, LOCK_EX are undeclared
    on IRIX and Solaris. Thanks to Wilhelm Greiner for the fix.

0.6.3 -- 27-Apr-2004
  + Added support for full libpcap-style filtering capabilities inside
    pmacctd. This allows to bind arbitrary filters to each plugin (in
    addition to already existing chance to apply them to the listening
    interface via 'pcap_filter' configuraiton key). The config key to
    specify these new filters is 'aggregate_filter'.  
  + Strongly improved networks definition file handling; now the file is
    parsed and organized as a hierarchical tree in memory. This allows to
    recognize and support networks-in-networks. 
  + Initial optimizations has been done over the code produced in last
    few months. 
  + Preprocessor definitions has been added to some part of the code, to
    allow pmacctd compile over IRIX. It has been reported to work over a
    IRIX64 6.5.23 box. Thanks to Wilhelm Greiner for his efforts.
  + Added flock() protected access to recovery logfiles.
  ! Fixed an ugly SEGV issue detected in both 0.6.2's logfile player tools.

0.6.2 -- 14-Apr-2004
  + Added support for networks aggregation. Two new primitives has
    been added 'src_net' and 'dst_net' to be used in conjunction with
    a network's definitions file (path is supplied via 'networks_file'
    configuration key). An example of this file is in the examples/
    directory. 
    When this aggregation is enabled, IP addresses are compared against
    the networks table; then the matching network will get written to
    the backend; if any match occurs a '0.0.0.0' is written.
    A really big thank goes to Martin Anderberg for his strong support
    during last weeks. 
  + pipe() has been thrown away; socketpair() has been introduced to
    set up a communication channel between pmacctd core process and
    plugins.
  + Added 'plugin_pipe_size' configuration key to adjust queue depth 
    (size) beween core process and plugins. A default value is set by
    operating system; it could not suffice when handling heavy traffic
    loads. Added also a specific error string when pipe gets filled.
  + Added 'plugin_buffer_size' configuration key to enable chances to
    bufferize data to be sent to plugins. When under great loads this
    helps in preventing high CPU usage and excessive pressure over
    kernel.
  + SQL plugins aliasing behaviour has been changed; when no free space
    for new data is found and old data has to be pulled out, it's now
    actually written to the DB but it's inserted in a new 'collision
    queue'. This new queue is purged together with the 'queries queue'.
    See INTERNALS for further details. 
  + SQL plugins cache behaviour has been changed by a direct-mapped
    one to a 3-ways associative to get better scores when searching
    free space for new data. See INTERNALS for further details.
  + Added 'sql_cache_entries' configuration key to adjust bucket's
    number of SQL plugin cache. As every hashed structure, a prime
    number of buckets is advisable to get better dispersion of data
    through the table.
  ! Fixed a malloc() SEGV issue in in-memory table plugin first
    noticed with gcc 3.3.3 (Debian 20040320) and glibc 2.3.2.
  ! Fixed a SEGV issue carried with last release. Improved handling
    of communication channels between core process and plugins. 
  ! Uniformed plugin's handling of signals; now sending a SIGINT to
    all pmacctd processes causes it to flush caches and exit nicely.
  ! Updated documentation; still no man page.

0.6.1 -- 24-Mar-2004
  + A new concept has been introduced: plugin names. A name could
    be assigned to each running plugin allowing to run more
    instances of the same plugin type; each one is configurable
    with global or 'named' keys. Take a look to examples for
    further info. 
  + Added support for PPPOE links. The code has been fully contributed
    by Vasiliy Ponomarev. A big thank goes to him.
  + Added a 'sql_startup_delay' configuration key to allow more
    plugin instances that need to write to the DB, to flush their
    data at same intervals but in different times to avoid locking
    stalls or DB overkills.
  + Improved handling of syslog connections. SIGHUP signal, used to
    reopen a connection with syslog (eg. for log rotation purposes),
    now is supported in all plugins. 
  + A simple LRU (Last Recently Used) cache has been added to the
    in-memory table plugin. The cache gives great benefits (exploiting
    some kind of locality in communication flows) when the table gets
    large (and chain in buckets become long and expensive to traverse).
  + Down-up of listening interface are now handled properly. Such an
    event traps a reopening of connection with libpcap. [EXPERIMENTAL]
  + Some work has been done (mostly via directives to preprocessor)
    in order to get pmacct compiled under Solaris. [HIGLY EXPERIMENTAL,
    translates: don't assume it works but, please, try it out and some
    kind of feedback would be appreciated] 
  ! Plugins have been better structured; plugin hooking has been
    simplified and re-documented; configuration parser has been
    strongly improved.
  ! Fixed a bug in 'configure' script; when supplying custom paths to
    MySQL libraries an erroneous library filename was searched for.
    (thanks to Wim Kerkhoff) 
  

0.6.0p3 -- 09-Feb-2004
  ! Fixed an issue concerning promiscuous mode; it was
    erroneously defaulting to 'false' under certain
    conditions. (Thanks to Royston Boot for signalling the
    problem)

0.6.0p2 -- 05-Feb-2004
  ! Fixed pmacct daemon in-memory table plugin unstability,
    noticed under sustained loads. (A thank for signalling
    the problem goes to Martin Pot) 
  ! Minor code rewritings for better optimizazion done in
    both in-memory table plugin and pmacct client.

0.6.0p1 -- 28-Jan-2004
  ! Fixed a bug in in-memory table plugin that was causing
    incorrect memorization of statistics. (Many thanks for
    promptly signalling it go to Martin Pot)
  ! Fixed a bug in pmacct client, used to gather stats from
    in-memory table. Under high loads and certain conditions
    the client was returning SEGV due to a realloc() issue.
    (Thanks to Martin Pot)

0.6.0  -- 27-Jan-2004
  + PMACCT OPENS TO POSTGRESQL: fully featured PostgreSQL
    plugin has been added; it's transaction based and
    already supports "recovery mode" both via logfile and
    backup DB actions. pmpgplay is the new tool that allows
    to play logfiles written in recovery mode by the plugin
    into a PostgreSQL DB. See CONFIG-KEYS and EXAMPLES for
    further informations. (Again, many thanks to Wim Kerkoff) 
  + Added new "recovery mode" action to MySQL plugin: write
    data to a backup DB if primary DB fails. DB table/user/
    password need to be the same as in the primary DB. The
    action could be enabled via "sql_backup_host" config
    key. 
  + Added a "sql_data" configuration optinion; a "frontend"
    value means to write human readable (strings) data; a
    "backend" value means to write integers in network byte
    order. Currently, this option is supported only into the
    new PostgreSQL plugin. See CONFIG-KEYS and README.pgsql
    for further informations.
  + Added support for simple password authentication in 
    client/server query mechanism for in-memory table
    statistics. It's available via "imt_passwd" config key. 
  + Added a "-t" commandline switch to pmmyplay; it runs
    the tool in a test only mode; useful to check header
    infos or logfile integrity.
  ! Fixed an ugly bug that made impossible MAC accounting 
    over certain links. Was affected only version 0.5.4. 
  ! Many code and structure cleanups.

0.5.4  -- 18-Dec-2003
  + Added a commandline and configuration switch to use 
    or not promiscuous mode for traffic capturing; useful 
    to avoid waste of resources if running over a router. 
  + Introduced a "recovery mode" concept for MySQL plugin:
    if DB fails an action is taken; currently is possible
    to write data to a logfile. More failover solutions to
    come in next releases. Thanks also to Wim Kerkhoff. 
  + Added a new "pmmyplay" tool. Allows to play logfiles
    previously written by a MySQL plugin in recovery mode.
    Check EXAMPLES for hints; see INTERNALS for further
    details about recovery mode and pmmyplay. 
  + Added syslog logging and debugging. Thanks for long
    brainstormings to Wim Kerkhoff.
  + Added chance to write PID of pmacctd core process to
    a specified file; it could help in automating tasks
    that need to send signals to pmacctd (eg. to rotate
    logfiles and reopen syslog connection). Take a look
    to SIGNALS file for further informations.
  + support for 802.11 Wireless links. [EXPERIMENTAL]  
  + support for linux cooked device links (DLT_LINUX_SLL).
    pcap library >= 0.6.x is needed. A big thank goes to
    KP Kirchdoerfer.
  ! Simplified client/server query mechanism; avoided all
    string comparison stuff. 
  ! Large parts of in-memory table plugin code has been
    revised to achieve better efficiency and optimization of
    available resources.

0.5.3  -- 20-Nov-2003
  ! pmacctd core has been optimized and a new loop-callback
    scheme driven by pcap library has been introduced; I/O
    multiplexing is avoided.
  ! In MySQL plugin, refresh of entries in the DB has been
    switched from a signal-driven approach to a lazy timeslot
    based one. If using historical recording, taking care
    to the choosen values, this greatly alleviates cache 
    aliasing.
  ! In MySQL plugin, modulo function (for insertion of data in
    the direct mapped cache) has been changed: crc32 algorithm
    has been adopted. Experimental tests shown the reduction of
    cache aliasing to about 0.45%. 
  ! The whole MySQL plugin has been inspected for performance
    bottlenecks resulted by the addition of new features in
    last releases.
  ! Fixed a bug in link layer handlers. 

0.5.2  -- 03-Nov-2003
  + "sql_history" configuration key syntax has been changed to
    support history recording at fixed times with mins, hrs and
    days granularity. A little of date arithmetics has been
    introduced (merely multiplicative factors, eg. to ease 95th
    percentile operations).
  + Added "sql_history_roundoff" configuration key to round off
    time of first timeslot. This little care gives cleaner time
    results and inductively affects all subsequent slots.
  + Achieved more precise calculations via timestamps added to
    the cache structure to avoid data counted during the current
    timeslot and not already fed in the DB to be accounted in next
    slot. 
  ! Monthly historical aggregation is no more available.
  ! Fixed portability issues posed by vsnprintf() in MySQL
    plugin. Now the plugin compiles smoothly under Tru64 Unix.

0.5.1  -- 01-Oct-2003
  + due to the proliferation of command-line options, the
    support for a configuration file has been added. All
    commandline switches until version 0.5.0 will be supported
    in the future.
    New configurable options (eg. log to a remote SQL server)
    will be only supported via configuration file. See 
    CONFIG-KEYS file for available configuration keys.
  + added support for historical recording of counters in the
    MySQL database. Available granularities of aggregation are
    hourly, daily or monthly (eg. counters are separated hour
    by hour, daily of monthly for each record). Timestamps of
    last INSERT and UPDATE have been added over each record.
    (thanks to Wim Kerkhoff for his strong collaboration)
  + support for IP header options.
  + support for PPP links. [EXPERIMENTAL]  
  ! Fixed a MySQL plugin direct-mapped cache issue: the cache
    now traps INSERT queries when an UPDATE fails due to any
    asyncronous table manipulation event (eg. external scripts,
    table truncation, etc.).
  ! MySQL plugin has been strongly revised and optimized; added
    options to save data to a remote sql server and to customize
    username, password and table; added MySQL locking stuff. 
    (another big thank to Wim Kerkhoff).
  ! various code cleanups.

0.5.0  -- 22-Jul-2003
  + static aggregation directives (src_host, dst_host, ..)
    are now superseded by primitives that can be stacked
    together to form complex aggregation methods. 
    The commandline syntax of the client program has been
    consequently changed to support these new features. 
  + two new primitives have been added: source MAC address
    and destination MAC address. 
  + support for 802.1Q (VLANs) tagged packets (thanks to
    Rich Gade). 
  + support for FDDI links. [EXPERIMENTAL]
  ! the core pmacctd loop (that gathers packets off the
    wire and feeds data to plugins) has been revised and
    strongly optimized. 
  ! the main loop of MySQL plugin has been optimized with
    the introduction of adaptive selection queries during 
    the update process.
  ! fixed a memory allocation issue (that caused a SIGSEGV,
    under certain circustances) in pmacct client: now the
    upper bound of dss is checked for large data retrieval.

0.4.2  -- 20-Jun-2003
  + limited support for transport protocols (currently
    only tcp and udp): aggregation of statistics for
    source or destination port. 
  + optimized query mechanism for in-memory table; solved
    few generalization issues that will enable (in future
    versions) to support complex queries. 
  + added "-t" pmacctd commandline switch to specify a
    custom database table. 
  ! fixed realloc() issue in pmacct client (thanks to
    Arjen Nienhuis).
  ! fixed an issue regarding mysql headers in the configure
    script. 

0.4.1  -- 08-May-2003
  ! missing break in a case statement that led pmacctd
    to misbehaviours; a cleaner approach to global vars
    (thanks to Peter Payne). 
  ! fixed an issue with getopt() and external vars. Now
    pmacct has reported to compile without problems on
    FreeBSD 4.x (thanks to Kirill Ponomarew).
  ! missing conditional statement to check the runtime
    execution of compiled plugins in exec_plugins()

0.4.0  -- 02-May-2003
  + switched to a plugin architecture: plugins need to
    be activated at configure time to be compiled and
    then used via "-P" command-line switch in pmacctd.
    See PLUGINS for more details.
  + added first plugin: Mysql driver. It uses a Mysql
    database as backend to store statistics other than
    in-memory table. See sql/ directory for scripts for
    creation of db needed to store data.
  + added the choice to collect statistics for traffic
    flows in addition to src|dst|sum aggregation via
    the "-c flows" command-line switch in pmacctd.
  + major code cleanups.
  + mostly rewritten configure script; switched back to
    autoconf 2.1.

0.3.4  -- 24-Mar-2003
  + accounting of IP traffic for source, destination
    and aggregation of both. Introduced -c switch to
    pmacctd (thanks to Martynas Bieliauskas).
  + added daemonization of pmacctd process via -D
    command line switch
  + added buffering via pcap_open_live() timeout handling
    on those architectures where it is supported.
  + It compiles and works fine over FreeBSD 5.x;
    solved some pcap library issues.  
  + added customization of pipe for client/server
    communication via -p command line switch both in
    pmacct and pmacctd
 
0.3.3  -- 19-Mar-2003
  + introduced synchronous I/O multiplexing
  + support for -m 0 pmacctd switch, in-memory table
    can grow undefinitely. 
  + revised memory pool descriptors table structure
  ! introduced realloc() in pmacct to support really
    large in-memory table transfers; solved additional
    alignment problems. 
  ! solved compatibility issues with libpcap 0.4 
  ! solved nasty problem with -i pmacctd switch
  ! solved various memory code bugs and open issues

0.3.2  -- 13-Mar-2003
  + support for pcap library filters 
  ! minor bugfixes

0.3.1  -- 12-Mar-2003
  + documentation stuff: updated TODO and added INTERNALS
  + revised query mechanism to server process, added a
    standard header to find command and optional values
    carried in query buffer.
  + added -s commandline switch to customize the size of
    each memory pool; see INTERNLS for more informations
  ! stability tests and fixes 
  ! configure script enhancements

0.3.0  -- 11-Mar-2003
  ! not public release
  + increased efficiency through allocation of memory pools 
    instead of sparse malloc() calls when inserting new
    elements in in-memory table.
  + added -m commandline switch to pmacctd to set the number
    of available memory pools; the size of each memory pool is
    the number of buckets, chosen with -b commandline option,
    see INTERNALS for more informations.
  + switched client program to getopt() to acquire commandline
    inputs.
  + new -m commandline  option in client program to acquire
    statistics of a specified IP address in a format useful for
    acquisition by MRTG program; see examples directory for a
    sample mrtg configuration.
  ! major bugfixes
  ! minor code cleanups

0.2.4  -- 07-Mar-2003
  + portability: Tru64 5.x 
  ! configure script fixes
  ! minor bugfixes

0.2.3  -- 05-Mar-2003
  + first public release
  ! portability fixes
  ! minor bugfixes


0.2.2  -- 04-Mar-2003
  + minor code cleanups
  + added autoconf, automake stuff


0.2.1  -- 03-Mar-2003
  + fork()ing when handling queries  
  + signal handling
  + command-line options using getopt() 
  + usage instructions
  ! major bugfixes


0.2.0  -- 01-Mar-2003
  + dynamic allocation of in-memory table
  + query (client/server) mechanism 
  + added a Makefile
  ! major bugfixes


0.1.0  -- late Feb, 2003
  + Initial release
