NAME:
  pmacct (Promiscuous mode IP Accounting package) v0.12.0rc1
  pmacct is Copyright (C) 2003-2008 by Paolo Lucente


DESCRIPTION:
  pmacct is a small set of passive network monitoring tools to measure, account,
  classify, aggregate and export IPv4 and IPv6 traffic; a pluggable and flexible
  architecture allows to store collected network data into memory tables or SQL
  (MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL) databases and export them through NetFlow or sFlow
  protocols to remote collectors. pmacct supports fully customizable historical
  data breakdown, flow sampling, filtering and tagging, recovery actions, and
  triggers. Libpcap, sFlow v2/v4/v5 and NetFlow v1/v5/v7/v8/v9 are supported, both
  unicast and multicast. Also, a client program makes it easy to export data to
  tools like RRDtool, GNUPlot, Net-SNMP, MRTG, and Cacti.

  Aggregation revolves around the key concept of primitives (source and destination
  MAC addresses, hosts, networks, ports, AS numbers, VLAN id, IP protocol and ToS/DSCP
  field are supported) which may be arbitrarily combined to build custom aggregation
  methods. Layer 7 (application) classification is fully extensible: classifiers are
  either based over regular expressions (RE) patterns or dynamic shared objects (SO).
  They are both loaded at runtime. Many RE patterns for popular protocols are already
  available through the L7-Filter project.

  IP accounting is the key for a range of operations like billing, live or historical
  traffic analysis or pricing models application; it is also a valuable way to go for
  the enforcement of thresholds while measuring the the underlying network.  
  Taking SNMP data from physical or virtual interfaces of network equipments sometimes
  is not too useful because of coarse granularity of counters. Finer granularities are
  reached if counters match consistent logical entities (such as departmental networks,
  Autonomous Systems, specific traffic flows, etc.).

  Many network equipments support redirection of network traffic to a replication port;
  non-blocking architectures help in not negatively affect the global performances and
  routing/forwarding operations when mirroring data. Alternatively, software probes or
  high-end equipments implement export protocols, like sFlow or Netflow. Both them leave
  leave new chances to monitor the network online (but not inline), off critical paths.
  This translates in new opportunities arising for advanced data manipulation or post-
  processing activities.
