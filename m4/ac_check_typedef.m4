# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_CHECK_TYPEDEF(TYPEDEF, HEADER [, ACTION-IF-FOUND [, ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND ]])
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   Check if the given typedef-name is recognized as a type. The trick is to
#   use a sizeof(TYPEDEF) and see if the compiler is happy with that.
#
#   This can be thought of as a mixture of AC_CHECK_TYPE(TYPEDEF,DEFAULT)
#   and AC_CHECK_LIB(LIBRARY,FUNCTION,ACTION-IF-FOUND,ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND).
#
#   A convenience macro AX_CHECK_TYPEDEF_ is provided that will not emit any
#   message to the user - it just executes one of the actions.
