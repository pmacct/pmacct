! Pre-Tagging map -- multiplexes various fields into a 4-bytes numerical-only ID 
!
! File syntax is key-based. Position of keys inside the same row (rule) is not relevant;
! Spaces are not allowed (ie. 'id = 1' is not valid). The first full match wins (like in
! firewall rules). Negative values mean negations  (ie. match data NOT entering interface
! 2: 'in=-2'); 'id', 'id2', 'ip' and 'filter' keys don't support negative values. 'label',
! 'jeq', 'return' and 'stack' keys can be used to alter the standard rule evaluation flow.
!
! nfacctd: valid keys: id, id2, ip, in, out, engine_type, engine_id, nexthop, bgp_nexthop,
! src_as, dst_as, peer_src_as, peer_dst_as, v8agg and filter; mandatory keys for each
! rule: id or id2 and ip.
!
! sfacctd: valid keys: id, id2, ip, in, out, agent_id, nexthop, bgp_nexthop, src_as,
! dst_as, sampling_rate and filter; mandatory keys for each rule: id or id2 and ip.
!
! pmacctd: valid keys: id, id2, src_as, dst_as and filter. Only either id or id2 are
! mandatory for each rule. 
!
! list of currently supported keys follow:
!
! 'id'			tag assigned to a matching packet, flow or sample; its use is
!			mutually exclusive with id2. 
! 'id2'			tag assigned to a matching packet, flow or sample; its use is
!			mutually exclusive with id.
! 'ip'			IP address of the device which is originating sFlow or NetFlow
!			datagrams (router, probe, etc.)
! 'in'  		Input interface 
! 'out' 		Output interface 
! 'engine_type'		In NetFlow V5 it's compared against the 'engine_type' header
!			field. In NetFlow V9 it's compared against the 3rd byte of
!			the 'source_id' header field. Provides uniqueness with respect
!			to the routing engine on the exporting device.
! 'engine_id'		In NetFlow V5 it's compared against the 'engine_id' header
!			field. In NetFlow V9 it's compared against the 4th byte of
!			the 'source_id' header field. It provides uniqueness with
!			respect to the particular line card or VIP on the exporting
!			device.
! 'nexthop'		IPv4/IPv6 address of the next-hop router
! 'bgp_nexthop'		IPv4/IPv6 address of the next-hop BGP router
! 'filter'		Matches incoming packets against the supplied filter expression
!			(expected in libpcap syntax); the filter needs to be enclosed in
!			quotes ('). In order to get support for MPLS label hierarchies,
!			the use of CVS versions >= 06-06-2005 of libpcap is adviceable:
!			they include the support for expressions like "mpls 100000 and
!			mpls 1024" that will match packets/flows with an outer label of
!			100000 and an inner label of 1024. 
! 'v8agg'		In NetFlow V8 it's compared against the aggregation method in use.
!			Valid values are in the range 0 > value > 15. 
! 'agent_id'		In sFlow v5 it's compared against the subAgentId field. sFlow v2
!			and v4 lack of such field, so it does not apply.
! 'sampling_rate'       In sFlow v2/v4/v5 it is compared against the sampling_rate field;
!			It also works against NetFlow v5. NetFlow v9 is unsupported.
! 'src_as'		source Autonomous System Number. In pmacctd it works only against
!			a Networks map (see 'networks_file' directive); in nf|sfacctd it
!			works against a Networks Map, the source ASN field in either sFlow
!			or NetFlow datagrams and, since release 0.12.0, the BGP RIB of the
!			exporting device (see 'nfacctd_bgp' directive).
! 'dst_as'              destination Autonomous System Number. Same 'src_as' remarks hold
!			here. Please read them above.
! 'peer_src_as'		peering source Autonomous System Number. This is compared against
!			the BGP RIB of the exporting device (see 'nfacctd_bgp' directive).
! 'peer_dst_as'		peering destination Autonomous System Number. Same 'peer_src_as'
!			remarks hold here. Please read them above.
! 'local_pref'		Destination IP prefix BGP local preference attribute. This is
!			compared against the BGP RIB of the exporting device.  
! 'label'		Mark the rule with label's value. Labels don't need to be unique:
!			when jumping, the first matching label wins. Label value "next"
!			is reserved for internal use and hence not to be used in a map.
!			Using it might give unexpected results.
! 'jeq'			Jump on EQual. Jumps to the supplied label in case of rule match.
!			Jumps are Only forward. Label "next" is reserved and causes to go
!			to the next rule, if any.
!			Before continuing the map workflow, tagged data can be optionally
!			returned to active plugins (ie. jeq=xxx return=true). Disabled by
!			default (ie. return=false). Beware setting return=true, depending
!			on configuration, can generate spurious data and/or duplicates;
!			the logics by which this would work is: plugins which include 'tag'
!			as aggregation will receive each tagged copy (if not filtered out
!			by the pre_tag_filter directive, indeed); plugins not configured
!			for tags will only receive a single copy of the data.
! 'return'		Works only associated to a 'jeq' and is set to 'false' by default.
!			Read full context details in the 'jeq' section. If set to 'true',
!			after tagged data is sent for accounting the tag is reset making
!			in practice this feature mutually exclusive with a 'stack' one.
! 'stack'		Currently '+' (ie. sum symbol) is the unique supported value. This
!			key makes sense only if JEQs are in use. When matching, accumulate
!			tags, using the specified operator/function. By setting 'stack=+',
!			the resulting tag would be: <tag>=<previous ID + current ID>.

! A few examples NetFlow-related. The format of the rules is the same of 'sfacctd' ones
! but some keys don't apply to it. Note that the format of 'pmacctd' rules is slightly
! different.
