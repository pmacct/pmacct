! tee_receivers: Tee receivers map
!
! File syntax is key-based. Read full syntax rules in 'pretag.map.example' in
! this same directory.
!
! nfacctd, sfacctd: valid keys: id, ip, tag, balance-alg, src_port; mandatory
! keys: id, ip.
!
! list of currently supported keys follows:
!
! 'id'                  SET: Unique pool ID, must be greater than zero.
! 'ip'                  MATCH: Comma-separated list of receivers in <host>:
!			<port> format. Host can be a FQDN or an IPv4/IPv6
!			address.
! 'tag'			MATCH: Comma-separated list of tags for filtering
!			purposes; tags are previously applied to datagrams
!			via a pre_tag_map map and then matched here with a
!			tee_receivers map.
! 'balance-alg'		SET: Enables balancing of datagrams to receivers
!			within the pool. Supported algorithms: 'rr' round-
!			robin, 'hash-tag' hashing of tag (pre_tag_map)
!			against the number of receivers in pool, 'hash-agent'
!			hashing of the exporter/agent IP address against
!			the number of receivers in pool, 'hash-crc32' same
!			as hash-agent but uses crc32 as hash function.
! 'src_port'		SET: When in non-transparent replication mode, use
!			the specified UDP port to send data to receiver(s) 
! 'kafka_broker'	SET: Defines the Kafka broker host to emit to. It
!			expects a string like 'localhost:9092'. 
! 'kafka_topic'		SET: Defines the Kafka topic to emit to. Mandatory
!			to specify when a kafka_broker is defined.
! 'zmq_address'		SET: Defines the ZeroMQ queue address to bind to.
!			It expects a string like '127.0.0.1:50000'. 
!			
!			
! Examples:
!
! Just replicate to one or multiple collectors:
!
id=1	ip=192.168.1.1:2100
id=2	ip=192.168.2.1:2100,192.168.2.2:2100
id=3	ip=[::1]:2100
!
!
! Replicate with selective filtering. Replicate datagrams tagged as 100 and
! 150 to pool #1; replicate datagrams tagged as 105 and within the tag range
! 110-120 to pool #2. Replicate all datagrams but those tagged as 150 to pool
! #3. 
!
id=1	ip=192.168.1.1:2100			tag=100,150
id=2	ip=192.168.2.1:2100,192.168.2.2:2100	tag=105,110-120
id=3	ip=192.168.3.1:2100			tag=-150
!
!
! Replicate with balancing. Round-robin enabled in pool#1
!
id=1	ip=192.168.1.1:2100,192.168.1.2:2100	balance-alg=rr
