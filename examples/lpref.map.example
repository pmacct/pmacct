! File syntax is key-based. Read full syntax rules in 'pretag.map.example' in this same

! nfacctd, sfacctd: valid keys: id, ip, in, bgp_nexthop, src_mac.
!
! list of currently supported keys follow:
!
! 'id'			ID value to assign to a matching packet or flow. Other than local
!			preference values, this field accepts also the 'bgp' keyword which
!			triggers a BGP lookup and returns its result: useful to handle
!			exceptions.
! 'ip'			IP address of the device which is originating sFlow or NetFlow
!			datagrams (router, probe, etc.)
! 'in'  		Input interface 
! 'bgp_nexthop'		BGP next-hop of the flow source IP address (RPF-like). This value
!			is compared against the BGP RIB of the device originating the sFlow
!			or NetFlow datagram (see 'nfacctd_bgp' directive).
! 'peer_dst_as'		First AS hop within the AS-PATH of the source IP address (RPF-like).
!			This value is compared against the BGP RIB of the device originating
!			the sFlow or NetFlow datagram (see 'nfacctd_bgp' directive). 
! 'src_mac'		Source MAC address of the flow. Requires NetFlow v9 or sFlow as
!			NetFlow v5 lacks of such support.
!
! A few examples follow. Let's define: LP=100 identifies customers, LP=80 identifies peers
! and LP=50 identifies IP transit.
!
! Customer connected to router with IP address 192.168.2.1, SNMP ifIndex 7 
!
id=100		ip=192.168.2.1	in=7

! A way to model multiple services, ie. IP transit and peering, off the same interface.
! Realistically services should be delivered off different sub-interfaces, but still ... 
! 
id=50		ip=192.168.1.1 	in=7	bgp_nexthop=1.2.3.4
id=80		ip=192.168.1.1 	in=7	bgp_nexthop=1.2.3.5
