The 'agent_id2' field.
Such field is being introduced to better support traffic matrix scenarios, where it
can be handy to have a tag to represent "qualities" of the source (say, agent_id) and
an additional one to represent "qualities" of the destination (say, agent_id2). But of
course this is only an example. The 'agent_id2' field is currently unique of its kind:
* It is not declared as part of any default table version; yet will not fail version
  checks which are enabled when 'sql_optimize_clauses' feature is disabled.
* It has to be manually added to the SQL schema: "agent_id2 INT(4) UNSIGNED NOT NULL,"
  and to the index/primary key, ie. "PRIMARY KEY (..., agent_id2, ...)" 

The 'agent_id2' field is currently unique of its kind although it is envisioned that
further new fields can be introduced this same way in the future - depending on their
scope and nature.
